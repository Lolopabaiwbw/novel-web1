Chapter 36

"Liam, why did you come? Didn’t I say you didn’t have to pick me up?" Emma was like a little bird as she fluttered happily over to her man.


"I was worried. It’s raining outside." Liam took off his jacket to drape over her, his gaze unhappy. "Why are you wearing so little?"


Emma’s expression was as sweet as honey. "Oh you, how old do you think I am, you still treat me like a child!"


Luna was unsteady as she pressed against the icy cold wall, and felt that she was really unlucky.


All night, if she wasn’t witnessing the parental love directed at Emma, then she was a spectator to Emma’s love life.


As if this wasn’t enough, Emma purposely grabbed onto Liam’s arm and led him towards her, saying warmly, "Junior Sister, I can tell you’ve drunk a little too much. How about we leave together? I’ll have my boyfriend drive you back!"


Emma intentionally emphasized the word ‘boyfriend’.


Only then did Liam notice Luna. The moment he saw her, his pupils contracted.


Luna…


It had already been a long time.


They hadn’t met even once during those years that she was gone overseas, and after her return, he had only seen her from afar when he picked Emma up from the company a few times.


He was not prepared for what he saw — she had changed so much that he almost couldn’t recognize her.


That girl who had always worn braids and floral dresses in the past had somehow become a woman who could capture the hearts of all men…


Noticing Liam’s gaze on Luna, a trace of hostility flashed through Emma’s eyes as she tugged on his arm. "Liam, what do you say?"


Liam then came out of his reverie and immediately nodded his head. "Yes, let’s go together."


"Junior Sister Brown... Junior Sister Brown? Are you alright?" Emma pretended to be worried.


Luna waved her hand and shook her head. Because of the alcohol, her mind was growing more muddled, her heart was beating faster and her blood was rushing backwards. It felt as though there was a beast roaring inside her body, wanting to break out and tear the two fake faces before her to shreds.


"No need…" Luna stumbled in the direction of the bathroom before she lost control.


Emma smirked at Luna’s sorry-looking escape, but when she turned around to face Liam, her expression was one of hurt. "Liam, Luna doesn’t seem like she wants to forgive me… I already worked so hard to make it up to her. In the company, I tried to take care of her, and yet she shows me a face like that. I really don’t know what else I can do…"


"Don’t worry, Luna is always like this. Give her time and she’ll eventually forgive you!" Liam consoled her in a soft voice.


Outside the hotel, ladies from the crew were excitedly admiring Liam’s high-end car.


"I just checked, this Maserati is worth at least 10 million, it’s so expensive!"


"I also want to find a rich boyfriend, just how many years will it take me!"


"More importantly, he’s so handsome! So many celebrities marry rich, but they’re all to fat, middle-aged men, seeing that really turns my stomach…"


…


While everyone was gossiping, they all saw Liam and Emma leave the hotel together.


A good-looking couple standing together really drew the eye.


Everyone watched enviously as Emma, with Liam’s jacket draped over her, stepped into the luxurious car, and only after the car was out of sight did they release longing sighs.


But not long after the car had left, there was a sudden piercing sound as a silver-white silhouette appeared and drew closer. It was a sports car speeding over, stopping right at the entrance of the hotel.


More importantly, this car…


This car was too dazzling!


Such a handsome, low chassis, a smooth body and cool scissor doors — it was a work of art…


Even more importantly, the price…


"Fuck me, that’s the Bugatti Veyron SuperSport, the world’s most expensive sports car. It costs approximately over a million dollars... mother… which god of fortune is this…"
