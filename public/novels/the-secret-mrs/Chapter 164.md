Chapter 164

"You’re awake." Theo was afraid of scaring and disturbing her, so he lightly walked over and brushed his palm gently over her messy hair.


"Theo…" Luna was slow to look at him.


"Yes, how does your body feel?"


Luna appeared dazed. "Is this the hospital? What happened to me?"


"You fainted last night because of a 39oC high fever." Recalling that moment yesterday when she had suddenly fainted caused Theo’s expression to darken.


Luna shook her head. "I had a fever? Why does my body feel so light, like I don’t have any strength!"


"You must be hungry. You slept for nearly a whole day and night," Theo said as he helped her unfold the meal table on her bed. Then he placed a pillow behind her back. "I assumed you would be up soon, so I bought dinner for you just now."


"Thanks…" Luna looked at the busy man before her. She pressed her lips together, and couldn’t resist extending one hand to touch his chin.


The warmth of her fingertips caused Theo to freeze, and he looked at the girl, whose gaze was incomparably warm. "Yes? What is it?"


Luna furrowed her brow as she looked at his worn-out appearance and the stubble above and below his mouth. "Did you take care of me all night? All your stubble has grown out!"


"It’s alright. I did sleep for a while." In reality, he hadn’t rested his eyes for even a minute, nor had he been in the mood to wash his face or rinse his mouth. Only when she woke up was he able to relax.


"Eat your dinner. Since you can’t have anything too fattening right now, there’s only plain congee. Wait until you’re better, then I’ll buy you something tasty." Theo placed the bowl of congee and spoon into her hands. "Do you have the strength to eat? Do you need my help?"


Luna didn’t say a word, and she also didn’t move.


Theo raised his head suspiciously to look at her. "What is it? Are you feeling uncomfortable somewhere on your body? I’ll go call the doctor…"


Luna quickly pulled him back, "Ah, I’m fine. I’m just not completely awake, so I’m a bit out of it…"


Theo let out a breath of relief. "Right now, what you need the most is rest, so don’t think too much."


"Mm." Luna nodded her head before diving into her bowl of congee. But she still did not appear to be in good condition, and looked only half-conscious.


Theo treated her so nicely, she almost felt terrified.


It was not as though she was dense, but from the beginning, the way he treated her had always been like this. She had continuously overlooked it, until she had gradually become accustomed to it.


Everything which the man before her had done, was it all simply to repay a debt of gratitude?


Even if he saw her as just a friend, would a friend do so much to this extent?


Because her mind had been filled with too many messy things she had had to deal with, in the end she only thought of this fleetingly…


…


…


After eating dinner, Luna finally felt that she had recovered some of her spirit.


She quickly shifted through all the complicated thoughts inside her brain, and began dealing with the important issues. "Theo, is my phone here?"


Theo did not look pleased. "I just said you need to rest well."


Luna clasped her hands together. "I’ve rested enough after sleeping for so long. Also, I’m full from eating. If you don’t let me do something, I’ll start rotting!"


Theo saw that she did look a lot better, and couldn’t resist her pleading gaze, so he ended up handing the phone over to her.


Afterwards, he brought the thermometer over. "Let’s take your temperature."


"Ah…" Luna obediently opened her mouth for the thermometer, and then immediately went on the Internet to go through the entertainment news.
