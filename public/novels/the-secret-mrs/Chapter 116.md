Chapter 116

Filming began.


Hawkers selling lanterns or hosting lantern riddles lined the streets, and people bustled about with lanterns in their hands. There was cheerful chatter and laughter everywhere.


Eden Miller had been confined in his clinic seeing patients, so Ella had dragged him out.


The camera followed the two people. Under the lens, a boy and a girl ran along Changan Street, which was ablaze with light. It was an incomparably beautiful scene…


This scene didn’t have a lot of dialogue, and focused mainly on the scenery and changes in the main characters’ expressions.


Ella was in high spirits. Eden had been reluctant in the beginning, but was eventually infected by the girl's enthusiasm. They walked together in the crowd.


After a while, Eden suddenly realized that the girl was still pulling on his hand, so he hurriedly struggled to free himself.


Ella held on obstinately, her expression proclaiming that the hand belonged to her.


Eden said urgently, "Miss Smith, please behave yourself. Men and women are forbidden to have intimate contact!"


Ella frowned as she stared at him. "You nerd, if I let go and we’re separated, then what?"


"If we get separated, then so be it!" Eden was so annoyed and ashamed that he spoke without thinking.


"Eden! You…" Angry, Ella threw his hand away and ran into the crowd.


Seeing the red of her clothes gradually disappear into the crowd, Eden’s expression gradually became more anxious. Recently, there had been rumors of a rapist in the capital, and girls from a number of households had already gone missing. It was so chaotic in the street today, and she was just a girl, what if something happened to her!


At this moment, Eden only felt concern for Ella, completely forgetting that she was a little devil — even if she encountered the rapist, he would be the unlucky one.


The camera lens began to follow Eden as he searched non-stop for Ella. Just as Eden was about to collapse, someone suddenly patted him from behind on his shoulder.


When he turned around, he saw a lively person in a mask standing in front of him, who spoke in a triumphant voice. "Doctor Miller, you were looking for me!"


Hearing the girl's familiar voice, Eden came alive again with joy, and pulled her into his arms.


Eden was always so pedantic and conservative, and it was clear that Ella hadn’t expected him to act that way, so she instantly froze…


The next scene was when Ella would initiate a kiss with Eden. The fans watching at a distance held their breaths in excitement, and were afraid to make a sound. Just imagining the first kiss between the two people, they knew it would definitely be the most beautiful scene!


At the same time, there was a person who was even more afraid to make a sound, and that was Cleo, sitting in the black car.


Cleo curled up against the window as far away from his brother as possible, so scared he didn’t even dare open his eyes to look.


He definitely didn't believe that his brother could watch them without doing anything; just now, seeing Luna hold Adam’s hand, and the image of the two people hugging, the temperature in the car had already plunged to freezing. What would happen when they actually kissed?


There wasn’t going to be a bloody scene later, was there?


Whatever Cleo let himself think, he still couldn’t figure out how his brother would stop the scene without making Luna angry.


Cleo carefully looked at the screen between his fingers, and saw Luna slowly remove her mask. She looked at Adam with deep affection, reached out to pull Adam down by the neck…


Over, over, it was over! Someone was going to die!


As Cleo wailed in his heart, he suddenly saw the lanterns on set go out one by one, as if they were being extinguished by his brother’s silently burning rage. What a terrifying sight!
