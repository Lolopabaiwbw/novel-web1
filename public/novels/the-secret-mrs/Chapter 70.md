Chapter 70

Who was the hottest young hunk in the entertainment industry at the moment?


No matter who you ask, everyone will give you this name, Adam!


Mia still couldn’t accept the fact until now, and she paced back and forth irritably. "Is this a mistake? Shouldn't Adam be filming overseas? Even if he’s come home, how could he act as a minor second male lead?"


Emma said thoughtfully, "Everyone says that Adam doesn’t play any other role apart from the male lead. Also, the main investor for this movie is Starlight. Why would he, a Glory World artiste, act in it?"


Mia, who had just been thinking how lucky she was that she wouldn't be taken advantage of, was about to go crazy. "Damn it! Why is it like this? How did Luna get so lucky? Adam should be mine, he’s mine! It’s because she shamelessly stole my role!"


Everyone around her looked at her with sympathy, and weren't surprised by her frenzy.


Because everyone in the entertainment industry knew that Mia liked Adam; she had publicly expressed her affection for him before on Weibo. Even though Adam paid no attention to her, she still frequently forwarded information related to Adam on Weibo like a fan.


It took David a great deal of effort to finally calm the crazy girls down. He couldn’t help teasing, "Adam, look how you’ve captured our girls’ hearts! A handsome boy is really treated so well!"


Adam went along with the director’s teasing and joked, "Director, didn’t you hear it just now? They only want to sleep with me, so you must protect me!"


"Hahaha… relax, your partner is the goddess of war Ella Smith, she can protect you! That’s right, where’s Luna? She kept hounding me before about who her co-star would be. Why hasn’t she appeared yet?" David looked around.


Adam gave a strange half-laugh. "Don’t tell me I scared her away?"


"That really is possible, almost all the girls are your fans, and Luna might be one of them. Perhaps she was surprised at seeing her idol!" David said with a smile.


As they talked, Luna came over.


Within a short time, the expression on Luna’s face had become impenetrable, and she offered her hand to to the person in front of her with a smile. "Senior Adam, hello, I’m Luna. I’m honored to be able to work with you."


Although they were the same age, Adam had started his career earlier and was her senior, so he should be treated with more respect.


"Hello…" Adam smiled and gently gave her his hand. In the next second, he almost threw her hand away.


This damn girl, she almost crushed his bones.


It was an effort for Adam to maintain his cool expression, and he pretended to suddenly realize something. "Ah, Luna, it’s you…"


"What? You know each other?" David was surprised — not just the director, now the rest of the film cast and crew had their eyes fixed on Adam.


He smiled meaningfully. "Naturally."


Hearing his flirtatious tone and seeing everyone stare at her strangely, Luna was so angry that her hands started shaking. She almost couldn’t control the primal urge to hit him!


Noticing how her face paled with anger, Adam said slowly, "We worked together before on ‘The Blue Bird’."


"Hmm? Why didn’t Luna mention that?" David was surprised.


Luna felt like she had just had a narrow escape; her back was drenched in sweat. She answered humbly, "Director Hopper, I was just the martial arts stand-in for the first female lead. I never thought that Senior Adam would remember me."


David was pleased to hear that. "Oh, who knew the two of you would share such a fate! That’s good, since you’ve worked together before and you know each other, you shouldn’t need too much time to get used to each other. Shall we directly try a more intense connection?"


Luna: "Uh…" Connection? More intense? No, director! They’re not familiar with each other!


Adam smiled joyfully. "Ok!"


Seeing his evil little canines, Luna really wanted to pull them out with her bare hands.
