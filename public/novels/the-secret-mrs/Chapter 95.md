Chapter 95

Cleo looked like he was expecting praise and a reward. Theo responded generously. "Vacation extended to a month."


Cleo was so excited he almost jumped up to do a whole set of exercises right there, but instantly he felt immeasurable regret. "Brother, you’ll start to lose momentum if you let this drag on, why didn't you seize the chance to go all the way with her? Such a pity!"


Theo looked at him coldly. "What do you think the consequences would be if I had done that?"


"Hmm…" Cleo stroked his jaw, and spoke in a low voice. "You’ve been using Little Treasure as an excuse all this time to make her lower her guard, so that she would slowly become less wary of you. If you give the game away now… Luna would immediately run for the hills!"


Theo:"…"


Even though it was the truth, hearing Cleo lay it all out so bluntly really spoiled his mood.


Actually, he had intended to go all the way with her last night regardless of anything, but Luna’s extreme rejection and fearful reaction had cleared his head in a flash.


What happened after that proved that his method for dealing with it had been right, otherwise he might have really scared Luna away in that situation.


Why had she reacted that way, what had she experienced before…


"Brother, can I ask you something? Why has your mood been so erratic lately? Did something happen?" Cleo asked cautiously.


Actually, Cleo was putting it mildly; in reality, his brother had been acting just like a woman on her period, with an irritable and unstable temper.


Theo tapped out a rhythm on the arm of his chair with one long finger, and said quietly, "Adam was the one who sent the flowers that day."


"What did you say?" Cleo blanked out for quite a while before reacting to what Theo had said, and he immediately jumped to his feet in anger —


"Sheet! Adam is the Evil Fairy King! Didn't he just get back the day before yesterday? I even got word that he was going to play the second male lead in The World!"


He didn't expect Adam and Luna to have this type of connection. There had to be a hidden reason for why that kid had suddenly returned to the country, and why the first movie he was starring in after coming back happened to be this one! If it was because he knew that he and Luna would have many intimate scenes together, tsk tsk…


"Mm, let me think, did he and Luna meet up? And you saw them? And furthermore, what you saw was an incriminating scene?"


Theo:"…"


Cleo’s guesses, all correct.


"My god, no wonder you’ve been acting so strange lately!" Cleo paced back and forth. "I can’t believe we have a traitor in our midst! What about YS? Did you discover anything?"


There was a dark light in Theo’s eyes. "The man who delivered the diamond disappeared after leaving the set, and the diamond’s origin can’t be traced; most likely, it was smuggled in."


Cleo’s lips curled, and he was a little speechless. "Yet another headache, don’t tell me it’s someone who is also connected to the Goldberg family? Y… S… is there anyone with these initials around us? I don’t recall there being any!"


Sigh, his brother’s love life was so complicated. Other people had the romantic comedy, his brother had the detective mystery!


At this moment, Theo’s cellphone beeped; it was a text from Luna.


After reading it, a dangerous creature slumbering in Theo’s eyes started to move.


Curious, Cleo approached him. "Luna's text… what did she say?"


Why did his brother look like his wife had cheated on him?


Theo stared at the text for a few seconds, then made a direct call.


In villa no.6, Luna quickly picked up the call. "Hello, Theo, what’s up? Did you see my text? Don't forget to show it to Little Treasure!"


"I saw it, where are you?" Theo asked.


Luna looked at Adam, who was busy in the kitchen trying to show off his cooking skills. "I’m at Adam’s place, I have something I need to discuss with him, plus he just returned from overseas, so we’re eating together as a welcome for him."
