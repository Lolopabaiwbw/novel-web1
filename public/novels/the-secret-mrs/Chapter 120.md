Chapter 120

After Liam left, Adam was still in a bad mood. He slanted Luna a sideways glance and snorted coldly. "That was the guy you were once hopelessly in love with? There’s really something wrong with your eyes!"


Luna glanced at him casually. "I think it’s your eyes that aren’t working. Out of ten points, Liam this type of man can get at least nine points, okay?"


Hearing this, Adam exploded. "Fuck, why is it nine points, so high? How can he get so many points!"


Luna said matter-of-factly, "Because he’s a man I once loved. If I say he’s bad, wouldn’t that mean I’m just smacking myself in the face? And regardless of my bias, there’s no denying that he is indeed worth nine points, objectively speaking.


Liam's appearance is not like yours, which blinds people with just one glance. He wins in terms of temperament, and he has a gentle and elegant style. In a fairytale world, he would be the prince, in ancient times, he would be the son of nobility. A man of unparalleled dignity and elegance… In short, he was the type I liked the most when I was a young girl, the kind that I would fall for at first sight!"


The fire in Adam’s chest burned even hotter. "Fuck, Luna, do you still have feelings for him? You're praising him to high heaven!"


Luna looked askance at him. "It’s only because I really don't care that I can talk with you about him in such a calm and objective way, alright? Why is your IQ so low!"


Furthermore, the person she was describing was the lively and perfect teenage boy who lived in her memories, not the current Liam.


Sometimes it was because the memory was too perfect that the reality was even more brutal in comparison.


It took Adam a long time before he calmed down, and asked in a thick voice. "Then how many points would you give me?"


Luna stroked her chin, and under Adam’s nervous gaze, said, "9.9 points! Your face can already get you that many points!"


After hearing this, Adam was immediately soothed, and he touched his face with a bit of pride. "Of course! This brother depends on his face to make a living! But why did you deduct 0.1 point?"


Luna looked at him like he was an idiot. "Do you still need to ask? It was obviously deducted because of your IQ!"


Adam: "…"


Forget it, forget it. He already had a high score of 9.9 points, there was no point arguing with this damn girl.


Adam's eyes flickered, and he couldn’t help asking, "Then… what about Theo? How many points would you give him? What kind of man do you think he is?"


"Hm, Theo ah…" This question was a bit hard for Luna to answer. She thought about it for a long time before she replied, "I don’t dare grade the Big Demon King. As for the type of man he is, one way to describe him is that he can be appreciated at a distance, but cannot be played around with.


The sea may seem calm on the surface, but you never know how scary the dark currents of the deep ocean can be. This kind of man is unfathomable, if you rashly draw too close to him, you’ll probably meet your end at the bottom of the sea!"


Adam's face softened a lot at her words. "Hmph, so you do still have a little sanity!"


"But…" Luna mused again.


"But what?" Adam nervously asked.


With her chin in one hand, Luna smiled, "But, if I die beneath a peony, I’ll still be charming as a ghost!"


"shit! Luna!"


"Hahaha, just kidding, just kidding, don't get so excited!"


Adam was almost angered to death. "I think the wine’s loosened your tongue! From the beginning, I already suspected you had designs on Theo! Do you really want to sleep with him?"


‘If I die beneath a peony, I’ll still be charming as a ghost’ can also be (whimsically) translated as ‘If my body should perish, girls I’ll still cherish’ .
