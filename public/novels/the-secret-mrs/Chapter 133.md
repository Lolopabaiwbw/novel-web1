Chapter 133

"Evil creature! What is with that look!" Robert Brown was enraged.


Just as he was about to explode, the door to the ward was opened from inside.


Robert and Rebecca Sterling forgot about Luna for the moment, and hurriedly went over. "Liam, how is Emma?"


"For the time being she’s fine, you can go in and see her." Liam looked tired when he answered, then he looked solemnly at Luna, who was standing outside the door with a swollen, red cheek.


Rebecca sprang to Emma’s bedside, and checked her from head to toe. "Mummy’s baby, how are you? Does it still hurt? Where does it hurt?"


Emma smiled weakly. "Mom, I’m fine, the doctor said it was only a light injury."


Rebecca’s heart hurt, and she stroked her hair gently. "You are a girl, how can it be okay for you to have such a big scar! If the sword had gone in a little deeper, you could have died! That damn girl, how can she be so evil! You still call her your elder sister!"


"Towards me, elder sister…" Emma’s expression dimmed, and she forced herself to speak. "Dad, mom, don't blame elder sister, it wasn’t her fault, it was a problem with the prop!"


Robert made a cold heng sound. "Silly child, how can you be so naive! That prop was completely fine, how could there have been a problem with it?"


Then he shouted furiously at Luna, who was still at the door. "Beast, why are you still dumbly standing there? Get yourself in here now and apologize to Emma!"


The indifferent look on Luna’s face was like an impenetrable mask. "I have nothing to apologize for. If you want an apology from me, fine, get proof. If there is any, even my life I’ll give to you."


Robert pointed at her with a shaking finger. "You still refuse to repent even now. The only reason I’m not investigating it is to give you face. You won’t shed a tear until you see a coffin, is that it? Do you really want to make me lose face?"


Heh, in Robert’s eyes, ‘face’ was always the most important thing.


Luna laughed coldly. "If I really wanted revenge against her, what you would be looking at now is her corpse, then when would you still have a chance to put on this father and daughter drama?"


Robert banged a table hard. "Don't get mouthy with me! Luna, are you going to apologize or not? If you properly acknowledge your mistake and apologize, then leave the entertainment industry, I’ll pretend this never happened, but if you insist on this path…"


"Thank you, I’ll choose my own path!" Luna laughed scornfully and waved one hand before she walked way without a backward glance.


Rebecca’s face was filled with disbelief. "Look at her! I absolutely cannot believe I gave birth to such a wicked thing!"


Furious, Robert paced in circles. "Monster! She’s a monster! She makes me so angry!"


Emma anxiously tried to persuade him. "Dad, it’s fine, don't be angry at elder sister, it’s not good for your health!"


"I already let her get away with it last time, but in the end she did this sort of thing, hurting you with her own hands. Next time she might really kill you, I absolutely cannot leave this as it is!"


"But, Dad…"


"It’s fine, leave it to me and don’t worry, I’ll deal with it."


"That’s right, let your father deal with it, you focus on recovering. Your father will definitely wrap things up satisfyingly for you!"


Emma’s eyes turned red as she struggled not to let her tears fall, her face full of gratitude. "Thank you, Mom and Dad, you really don't have to, I’m fine…"


Liam, who had been silent all this time, patted her shoulder. "Emma, you are too kind! But Luna really went too far this time. What Uncle said is right, we absolutely cannot let her do whatever she wants anymore!"
