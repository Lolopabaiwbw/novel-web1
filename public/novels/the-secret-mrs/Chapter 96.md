Chapter 96

"Okay, got it, I’ll be there soon," Theo said calmly.


Luna on the other end was shocked. " Ah? You’re coming?!"


"Why, problem?" Theo answered with his own question, his tone cold.


"No… I guess…" Theo sounded so matter-of-fact, that she couldn’t object in that moment.


Seeing Luna’s complicated expression after the call, Adam asked, "What’s up? Who was it?"


"Your uncle, he said he’s coming…"


"What?" The soup spoon dropped from Adam’s hand to the floor. Heartbroken, he pointed at her accusingly. "Luna, you said nothing was going on between you and him. This is our dinner together, did you ask him to come?"


"Calm down, can you not get angry so easily?" Luna gave him a haughty look. "I didn't invite him, he asked where I was, and I replied truthfully that I was going to give you a welcome dinner, then he said he was coming. Maybe he’s coming here to have dinner together because as your elder, he feels he should show you some concern? This is normal logic!"


Adam threw a bowl on the floor. "Normal your butt! Do you think Theo is that amiable and approachable a person? Even eating with me? When my mom invites him over for dinner, she has to be scheduled in, sometimes up to six months later! Unapproachable is his middle name!"


Luna threw a pillow at him impatiently. "You hopeless kid, can't someone show you some concern? And why do you always put me and Theo together? In what way are we actually compatible?"


Adam murmured to himself, "This is a man’s instinct… what do you know!"


As they were fighting, the door bell rang.


Luna glared at Adam to warn him not to speak nonsense, then stood up to answer the door.


As soon as the door opened, Luna’s eyes lit up, because a little bun was standing next to Theo.


As soon as Little Treasure saw her, he threw himself at her with open arms, like a little sparrow seeing its mama. Luna’s heart melted as she quickly picked him up and hugged him. "Darling, you came too! Just now Auntie was still feeling sad that I couldn’t have dinner with you tonight!"


In the house, Adam looked at Luna holding Little Treasure, then at Theo, who was looking at the two of them indulgently. They gave the impression of being a family of three.


He didn't expect Luna to be this close to Little Treasure.


Little Treasure was an even more difficult existence than his dad!


As for Theo, his attitude towards Luna was very strange.


Even if it was for Little Treasure’s sake, given Theo’s personality, how could he tolerate living under the same roof with an unfamiliar woman…


"Hey hey hey, don’t forget me, I’m also here!" Close on their heels, Cleo elbowed his way in, two bottles of wine in his arms.


Looking at the three GOldberg family members, Luna instantly gave Adam a "See, they organized a group visit to show care for a junior family member, you think too much" look.


"Eldest Uncle, Second Uncle, even Little Treasure is here, come in…" Adam had to obediently invite them in even if he wasn’t happy to.


Who asked him to have a low rank in the family…
