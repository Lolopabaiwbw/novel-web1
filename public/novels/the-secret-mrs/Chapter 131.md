Chapter 131

Seeing he had come, Emma’s expression instantly turned coy. "It’s your fault, you wore me out!"


"Hey, you were the one who came on to me!" Liam said helplessly. He lifted the plastic bag he was holding in one hand. "I bought chicken congee so that you can recover your strength since you’re always complaining you’re tired!"


"Don’t tease me!"


…


The second scene was a follow-up to the previous one, and was a fight in the bamboo forest.


Jenna Wilson thought that Ella Smith had become a demon — she wouldn’t listen to anything she said. After a short hesitation, she was ready to kill her on the spot to avoid any future trouble.


After being instructed by the stunt director for over two hours, the two persons were finally more or less ready.


At first, the director had been prepared to use stunt doubles, but Luna was good at martial arts, and had even been a stunt double for other people before, so she certainly didn't need it, while Emma also said she wanted to do it herself.


Naturally, David also wanted a better film effect, so he agreed.


The professional stunt master helped the two of them into the wire rigs, and checked them many times to make sure that there was no risk at all. Then the shoot started.


"Ella is dead." Jenna closed her eyes, and said it with pain and regret.


Standing before her was just a beautiful and dangerous shell, a lethal weapon which would destroy the world.


In the next second, the eyes of Jenna became violently murderous, and she swiftly drew the long sword from her waist and attacked Ella…


Ella seemed to have already anticipated her move, and her stance was calm and leisurely. It was only when the sword was a hair’s breadth away from her nose that she glided backwards like a bird, her arms spread and her toes brushing the ground, rapidly retreating to avoid Jenna’s attack.


Jenna snorted coldly and brandished her sword again.


Ella took her time avoiding her attack, like a cat playing with a mouse. Finally, she drew out a sword that had been tucked into the waistband of her red gauze dress at the back, and moved to retaliate aggressively.


After more than ten moves, Jenna was gradually getting pushed back, and several times had almost been knocked off the branch by Ella.


Even if Jenna was very good, before Ella, who had killed thousands of troops in the past, she was just a child.


Jenna thought too highly of herself, and thought that Ella’s skills had deteriorated after living in the palace for so long. By the time she helplessly realized that she had underestimated her enemy, it was too late.


In the end, Ella had had enough of playing around. With a cold gaze and the might of ten thousand armies, she thrusted the sword at Jenna’s chest…


Fizz —


It was the sound of a sharp weapon piercing flesh.


Jenna clutched her chest painfully, and like a broken paper kite, fell from the top of the bamboo sea…


The next shot was a close-up of Ella. David was watching Luna’s expression attentively, and realized that something wasn’t right.


"Emma’s hurt! Save her! Quick!" Luna, who was still hanging in the air on wires, suddenly shouted.


There was a stunned moment before the staff reacted to the fact that this wasn’t a line from the script. Emma had really gotten hurt!


The scene instantly turned chaotic, and everyone gathered around Emma.


After getting Emma down, Luna hastened to press down on the bleeding wound. "Call an ambulance, quickly!"


Just then, her body was suddenly and violently pushed to one side. It was Liam, who had run over in fright. He held Emma tightly in his arms. "Emma! Emma, are you alright?"


"Brother Liam… it hurts…"


"Don't be afraid, I’m here! You'll be fine! You’ll definitely be fine…"
