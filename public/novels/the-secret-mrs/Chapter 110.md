Chapter 110

Luna said sullenly, "Theo, are we really going to talk in this kind of position? Why don’t you put some clothes on first?"


Otherwise, she wouldn’t be able to focus on the issue!


"Fine." Theo finally said behind her.


It was as if Luna had been given a pardon, and she hurriedly fled the room.


Sigh, Theo was certainly a natural public speaker. In a few words, he had managed to pull at her heartstrings, especially when it was related to Little Treasure.


It was just that if she continued to stay here, and for three more months at that, she was afraid that it really would be a little inappropriate…


As she was debating the issue, she suddenly felt something soft on her leg. Looking down, she saw it was Little Treasure, who had come running without her noticing. As usual, he hugged her leg, and in one hand he held a painting.


Luna bent to hug the little guy. "Darling, you’ve finished drawing?"


Little Treasure nodded.


"What did you draw? Can Auntie see it?"


Little Treasure instantly gave her the picture.


With one look, Luna’s eyes filled with tears.


It was her in the picture.


The colors in the painting were bright and dreamy. She was lying on a small bed with a storybook in her hand. Little Treasure had drawn it from his point of view, as if he was lying next to her and looking up.


The whole painting radiated Little Treasure’s happiness and satisfaction at being glued to her side as he lifted his head to listen to her tell him a story.


"Darling, this is amazing!" The scales in Luna’s heart had completely tipped to one side.


She drew a deep breath to calm herself down. Then she kissed the little guy on his forehead and said happily, "Auntie bought you new clothes, do you want to try it on?"


Little Treasure nodded with sparkles in his eyes.


After Luna helped Little Treasure change and was just about to look for Theo, Theo walked out of his room after also getting changed.


Luna had been confident with the outfit she had picked out for Little Treasure, but she hadn’t been as certain with Theo’s outfit. After all, she had never seen Theo wear anything that was not black, white or grey, let alone a vibrant color like sapphire blue.


But after seeing Theo in the outfit, she was completely dumbstruck.


This… this fit him too perfectly…


At first she had thought it might look too out-of-place or awkward; she never expected such an amazing result.The suit showed off his wide shoulders, narrow hip and long legs perfectly. Most importantly, his heavy and solemn temperament had instantly become brighter, and even made him look a lot younger.


Theo was pleased by the admiration in the girl’s eyes. "So?"


Luna nodded, "So handsome! Pin a big red flower to your chest, and you can become a groom straightaway!"


Theo:"…" The way this girl praised people was really unique.


"Little Treasure, don't you think so? Isn't your papa handsome?" Luna lowered her head to ask the little bun, who was a mini-version of Theo.


Even though Little Treasure didn't care too much for his dad, he had to admit that this version of his daddy looked much better than the normally black one, so he nodded generously.


Luna was instantly pleased with herself, and she snapped her fingers, "I never realized my eye was that good! Of course, CEO Goldberg already has a good foundation, you look handsome in anything! But I think you should wear bright colors like this more often, it’ll lift your employees’ moods, and they’ll become more productive!"


Hearing the words "good foundation" and "you look handsome in anything", Theo couldn’t help curling his lips. "Mm, in the future, if you see anything else suitable, buy it for me."
