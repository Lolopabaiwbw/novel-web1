Chapter 2

"I’ll tell you the truth right now! That night you drank wine which I spiked. You were so lustful and unsatisfied that I found two good men for you. Who knew that you wouldn’t appreciate my kindness? You even barged into a stranger’s room and took advantage of that man…" Emmasaid disgustedly. "Liam is far too gentle and kind for his own good because when you woke up, he was afraid you wouldn’t be able to accept the truth, so he told you that it was him that night!"


"You…" Luna had started trembling as she heard this. She finally couldn’t hold it in any longer and grabbed Emmaby her arm. "Why do you treat me this way? Why?! Haven’t you screwed me over enough?"


Emma furrowed her brow, and just as she was about to push Luna away, she noticed Liam approaching them behind Luna. Her voice immediately softened and her expression turned pitiful, "Older Sister, I know I’m wrong. If you want to hit or yell, do it to me, please don’t blame Liam…"


Luna paused, and in the next second, Emmafell to the ground as if Luna had pushed her.


"Luna! What are you —" Someone said accusingly behind her.


Luna turned around and saw an unfriendly-looking Liam.


Liam brushed past her and helped Emmaup. "Emma, are you alright?"


Emmapressed nearly her entire body against Liam. "Liam, I didn’t mean it, I really know I’m wrong… this only happened because I wronged Older Sister…"


"That’s enough! Don’t blame yourself. No matter what happens, you have me!" Liam patted her shoulder and helped her into the car. "I’ll explain everything to Luna."


Luna’s mind was blank as she watched Liam stride towards her and open his mouth.


He spoke for a long time.


He spoke of the past and their happy childhood. He spoke of the struggle he went through when he fell in love with Ning Emma. He spoke of his fury and anger when he found out Emmahad schemed against Luna. He spoke of the fright and regret he felt when he found out about Luna’s pregnancy. He spoke about how he accepted Ning Emma’s apology…


In the end, he said, "Luna, I’m sorry. I can’t marry you — not because of that night nor because of the child that I don’t want — but because I cannot wrong Emma and because I can’t lie to myself about my feelings."


He and Emmahad been travelling outside the country in the past few months, and having been with her morning and night, it was harder to separate from her now more than ever. Although he had initially wanted to ease Luna’s pain by pretending that he did indeed have intercourse with her, in his heart, he had already chosen Ning Emma.


That was why after finding out that Luna was pregnant, he couldn’t stop himself from immediately going to the Ning family and explaining everything to the Second Master. Despite this, he had not told the truth to Luna herself.


"You mean… Liam… from the start, you knew that it was Emmawho drugged me and ruined my innocence? Just because you wanted to protect her, you told me the person that night was you?" Luna finally found her voice, but could only look numbly at Liam.


"Luna, Emma didn’t mean it. She’s still young so she might be impulsive…"


"Then what about me?" Luna looked up at Liam hopelessly. "Did you never once consider what it would be like for me?"


Liam did not speak, and there was a long moment of silence before he reached out for Luna’s hand. "The sun is too hot, let’s return home…"


"Don’t touch me —" Luna immediately slapped his hand away and laughed aloud.


Luna felt that her whole life until now had been a joke.


For Liam, she had worked hard to get into B University to come to the city where he lived.


For Liam, she had abandoned her dream to become an actress.


So that their family statuses would match, she had pushed aside her adoptive parents in order to return to the Ning family, and she had stupidly tried to please those so-called upper-class families.


And as a result of all her efforts, she only received: "I cannot wrong Emma."


Emmahad not only stolen her identity and her birth parents, but today… she had even stolen the person she loved most. Emmawas young… but even so, how could she be forgiven? If she really did forgive her, then who could she blame for her life's misfortune? She didn't even know who the man from that night was!


Luna covered her face, her body quivering, for she had reached the limit of her despair.


Liam watched as Luna mindlessly started to cross the road, and was about to chase after her when from behind, Emmatugged on his sleeve. "Liam, where are you going?"


In Liam's moment of hesitation, there was a loud bang; Luna was thrown back on the road and she hit the ground hard.


"Help! Help! A pregnant lady has been hit!"


In the piercing light, Luna could make out two silhouettes and faces which made her want to throw up. She felt her stomach cramp, and she slowly started to lose consciousness from the intense pain. She blinked, and the blood trickling down her forehead flowed into her eyes… she entered a world of darkness.
