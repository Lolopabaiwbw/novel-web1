Chapter 166

However, this maneuver was so perfect!


The only issue was that extortion, this kind of thing, if one were to personally go and do it, the conscience wouldn’t easily allow it…


Luna bit her lip as she remembered everything that had happened that night, and she laughed coldly inside her heart. Ah, what conscience, they had even gone to that extent!


Luna quickly made up her mind. "Alright, send it to me. I’ll contact Emma!"


"No need, I’ll help you. That way, no one can track down your IP address," Theo said.


At this moment, in Luna’s view, Theo was no different from a god. Her eyes glimmered as she said, "God Goldberg, I’ve realized your abilities are too heaven-defying! Do you accept disciples?"


Seeing the girl’s worshipful gaze elevated Theo’s mood a lot. He glanced at her. "I don’t accept."


Luna immediately appeared disappointed. "Ah…" As expected, he wasn’t accepting any! Big Boss Goldberg had so many things to take care of, so how could he possibly accept any disciples…


Theo continued to gaze deeply at her. "If you want my level of capability, there’s an even faster method."


"What is it, what is it?" Luna instantly perked up as she asked.


Theo: "Marry me." If she married him, everything that was his would also be hers, what else would she still need to learn?


"Cough cough cough…" Luna nearly choked on her own saliva.


This method, you really couldn’t say he was wrong…


It was just that… did she just get hit on again?


Theo admired the girl’s embarrassed expression, before asking, "Have you thought about which company you want to join after you dissolve your contract?"


Luna rubbed her chin. "This… I'm still thinking it over…"


Theo was undeterred as he continued. "After you've cleared your name, your popularity should be on par with first- and second-tier artistes. It'll be much easier to find a company then."


Luna sighed. "It's actually very troublesome. Small companies aren't very competitive and don't offer a good future, while big companies will be hard to get into because of my lack of background. I might appear very well-known, but most of my fame comes from bad press. I don't have even one finished work, so my position is pretty awkward… hmm, Teacher Goldberg, do you have any ideas?"


Regarding such an important decision, Luna had already intended to ask Theo for advice.


Theo poured a cup of water for her before replying: "From my perspective as a businessman, you are a very explosive stock full of rising potential. I believe you will prove your worth in the future. Therefore, I naturally hope you will join Glory World."


Luna speechlessly widened her eyes in disbelief, and was frozen for a while before coming back to her senses. "Is Lord Boss trying to personally poach me right now?"


Theo slightly smiled. "What you said is not wrong. I really do want to poach you. So, will you come?"


Damn it! This manner of speaking was foul play!


Luna gulped while calming her heart, and then seriously replied, "To be direct and honest, if this time, I am able to smoothly leave Starlight Entertainment, the company I most want to join is Glory World. Today, Glory World has already surpassed Starlight Entertainment and has indisputably become the best entertainment company in this industry, with the best future prospects…"


Theo appeared very pleased and nodded. Then he extended his hand towards her. "Then let’s have a pleasant cooperation."


"Ah?" Luna subconsciously extended her hand. "Let’s… let’s have a pleasant cooperation."


What… what was this situation? Just like that they were going to happily work together?


Just like that she had come to an agreement with Glory World?


The Great Demon King was so efficient even in poaching people…
