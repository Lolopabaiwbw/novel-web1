Chapter 39

"Screw him! Who do they think they are?!" All of a sudden, Luna threw a violent punch. If Theo hadn’t reacted fast enough, based on the strength of that punch, he would have ended up with a broken jaw.


"Girls shouldn’t say vulgar things." Theo frowned.


Although, she was also very cute when she was swearing.


Luna was incredibly drunk, but she still had some awareness left. She felt that the person hugging her meant her no harm and was incredibly gentle, so she slowly let her guard down. She remained in his lap and no longer struggled in his embrace, only continuing to speak in her drunken stupor. "This old woman doesn’t think it’s worth doing… otherwise, otherwise based on this old woman’s face… I can find an even bigger… the biggest and thickest thigh to hug… you all think you can suppress me… then I’ll go out and find… I’ll go now…"


Hearing this, Theo raised his eyebrows, then roughly took hold of her hands and placed them between his thighs. "The one with the thickest thighs in the capital is right here. Do you still want to go and look for one?"


Luna randomly squeezed the muscles in his thigh and felt around before exclaiming loudly, "Not thick! Not thick at all!"


Theo: "…"


He was actually given the cold shoulder because his was not thick enough.


There was no way that any man would accept this.


What was worse was that her hand had touched a place that shouldn’t have been touched, and she had even patted him there. "Hm, what is this… so annoying… it poked me…"


Her tone was filled with disdain.


Theo’s expression turned ugly.


If he let her continue on like this, he might do something that would go against his morals.


The person who had been outside was already long gone, so Theo immediately opened the door and carried Luna out.


They reached the underground parking.


The one who smugly opened the door for them was Cleo.


"Why is it you?" Theo frowned.


"I went over to your place to find you, but both you and Little Treasure weren’t there, so I came over to look for you two! Brother, you really don’t know the bro code. When did you even buy this car? It’s even cooler than the one you gave me! I feel like I don’t know anything!" Cleo looked like he had been wronged.


Theo ignored him and carried Luna into the back seat.


Cleo was sitting in the front, and turned his head to scrutinize Theo and Luna’s disheveled clothing, his face that of a gossipmonger. "Where did you pick her up? Why did you take so long? Look at Little Treasure, he almost became the Amah Rock!"


Little Treasure had pressed himself against the glass window as soon as he had seen Luna.


Theo was originally worried that Luna would be a rowdy drunk, but who knew that when Little Treasure approached her, she didn’t react in any extreme way, only looked at him and then hugged him like a comfortable pillow.


Theo was not the type to feed gossip, and he slowly took off his tie and jacket. "What happened today?"


At the mention of what he was best at — investigation — Cleo immediately lit up. "According to my sources, everything went well. You even used Arthur, so of course Luna successfully wowed the whole crowd, and the media responded positively towards her!"


"Who did she see tonight?" Theo asked another question.


Cleo tried to remember. "Besides the cast and crew, there was Robert Brown, and there was…"


Cleo glanced at his brother’s expression, and gulped before continuing. "Liam Johnson… my guess is that she got drunk like this because she saw her ex-boyfriend, who is now with her arch nemesis, Emma Brown, so she probably didn’t feel good…"


Although Cleo had deliberately taken care to speak carefully, Theo’s face still darkened in a flash.


He was really terrifying.
