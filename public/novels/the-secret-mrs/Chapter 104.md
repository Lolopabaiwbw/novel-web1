Chapter 104

Richard pinched the skin between his eyebrows and finally gave up on communicating with her. Trying to compete with a fool was the most idiotic thing to do.


The company had spent a lot of effort on Mia, but because of this matter, things were beyond recovery. However great the loss was, she could only be discarded.


Seeing that Richard had made up his mind, Mia rushed to Emma, clutching at straws. "Sister Emma, help me! Let Sister Sophia manage me! I guarantee I’ll definitely be obedient! I promise that I’ll post a letter of apology!"


When Sophia heard this, she instantly became frightened. Get her to take over Mia? Emma wouldn’t trap her like that, right?


Of course, Emma wasn’t as brainless as Mia, so she put on a troubled expression and she lamented regretfully, "Mia, it’s not that I’m not helping you. You heard Luna’s words just now, she’s not willing to help. Besides, this is the company's decision, I also have no choice."


After this issue had come out, she knew Mia was finished, but she still wanted to use her to the very end to drag Luna down with her. It was a pity that Richard had realized early on that an apology would be completely useless, and might also drag another company artiste into trouble; in the end, he just directly gave up on Mia.


She had thought Mia would be a good knife to use in dealing with Luna, who knew she was stupid enough to get pulled in herself, and even make Luna’s popularity soar. There was no way she would continue wasting energy on this type of person.


"Luna! You bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Wait and see! Even if I die, I’ll drag you down to die with me!" Mia finally lost hope, and took her anger out on Luna, until Richard called security and she was dragged away.


Towards this kind of person, Luna didn’t even bother to hate her, and could only pity her; even until now, she still didn’t know that she had been used as cannon fodder.


Richard looked at Luna with a far more relaxed expression on his face. "Luna, act well in this movie. If the outcome is good, the company will focus on cultivating you. But what Emma said just now makes sense. You should keep your head down for now, and don't stir up unnecessary trouble."


The whole affair was simply the perfect public relations crisis management scenario, from Luna being knee-deep in scandal to being washed completely clean, and instead Mia being forced to leave the entertainment industry.


Although Richard suspected that someone was working behind the scenes, he couldn’t find the slightest flaw, and could only attribute it to Luna’s good luck.


"Thank you, Director Boxx, I will." Luna pretended to be surprised and nervous.


After coming out of the meeting room, Luna went to the washroom, and Emma followed her in.


Emma crossed her arms over her chest and sneered at her. "Luna, you’re so good at digging up dirt on other people, aren’t you afraid your own unsavoury past will be exposed one day?"


Luna's eyes narrowed slightly and turned cold. She turned around, and said unconcernedly, "Who doesn’t have dirt on them, in this industry? You don’t? Eldest Miss Brown!"


Luna deliberately emphasized this form of address, Eldest Miss Brown, then pretended to be suddenly enlightened. "Ah! I’ve just realized, Mia’s title ‘fake daughter, real mistress’ unexpectedly is also very suitable for describing you! When the time comes for me to expose you, doesn’t it save me the trouble of finding a title for you?"


This hit Emma’s sore spot, and she immediately got furious. "What false daughter real mistress! Since I was born, I’ve always been part of the Brown family. I’m the only daughter Father has recognized. As for Liam, you’re the one who was useless and couldn’t keep his heart. Do you think anyone would believe your nonsense?"


Luna heaved a long sigh. "Then… shall we test it? Go ahead and expose that dark part of my past! There are so many people out there, so I haven’t been able to find the whereabouts of the two male hookers you bought off. Who knows, perhaps the general public might help me strike unexpected gold."
