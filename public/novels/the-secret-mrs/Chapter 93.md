Chapter 93

In the end, everyone wrapped up unhappily, and after Mia’s outburst, the director stopped filming for two days for Mia to get herself together.


As Luna was about to leave after getting her makeup taken off, Emma came in without her noticing, and crossed her arms as she looked down on Luna. "Luna, I never knew you were such a schemer!"


"Huh? Am I?" Luna looked with a half-smile at the wound on Emma’s arm where Mia had scratched her, then blinked, an innocent look on her face. "Isn't it that you have too good an eye, and really know how to pick your teammate?"


"You…" Emma gritted her teeth, her chest aching with anger.


How was she to know that Mia could be so brainless. There was already so much dirt on Luna, yet Mia was able to wipe her clean of it, to the point that everyone's attitude towards Luna was starting to change!


She had to think of a way to counter Luna’s next move; she couldn't let her stand back up again, no matter what.


As Luna walked out after that little confrontation with Emma, her cellphone beeped with an incoming message.


Evil Fairy King: I’m waiting for you at the alley in the front.


Luna replied cautiously: We leave separately, see you at home, I’ll look for you at your place.


An hour later, at the Platinum Palace No.6.


As soon as Luna arrived at the door, Adam immediately pulled her inside, peering left and right as if he was an underground spy.


Before, he hadn’t minded if people thought that there was something between him and Luna. In fact, he had actually wanted people to know that they were acquainted, but after this incident, he couldn’t help thinking about all his previous actions.


Luna put her bag down, kicked off her shoes, and sat cross-legged on the sofa. The first thing she asked, with her hand out, was: "Did you take the video?"


Adam looked speechlessly at how she didn’t care about her image. This damn woman, she had never seen him as a man, had she? Why was she always so casual and thoughtless in front of him, like a hooligan, exactly like the one she was in the movie!


"Do you think I’m also a pig teammate? Of course I filmed it!" Adam ill-naturedly handed his phone to her.


When she had said she was going to pretend to be a little white flower, he had guessed what she was going to do, so of course he had recorded the highlights.


Luna took the phone and pressed play, nodding in satisfaction, "Good job! One more drumstick for you!"


After saying that, she logged onto Weibo and put up a post on her official account. Of course it wasn’t an apology, like Sophia wanted, but just one phrase: Clean hands need no washing.


After she posted it, she logged into her side account and messaged a gossip blogger who covered everything about Glory World, and sent him the video of Mia’s continuous NGs.


As expected of two companies that were sworn enemies, it wasn’t long after Luna messaged the blogger that he immediately posted the video, along with an eye-catching title, "NGed 33 times, no.1 flower vase in the entertainment industry gives you an example of real sheetty acting".


Adam looked at her. "You only sent this one? You’re not going to use the others? It was hard for me to film secretly!"


Luna was busy reading comments. "This one is enough to get the ball rolling — do you think you were the only one who took videos?"


"By the way, why didn't you use that move earlier on Mia? If you had done it sooner, she would have been switched out long ago, and all this drama wouldn’t have happened. I still had to endure that woman for two days!" Adam grumbled in complaint.


Not one person on set understood why Mia had NGed non-stop; only Adam knew exactly what had happened.


In Chinese slang, ‘flower vase’ has the same meaning as eye candy.
