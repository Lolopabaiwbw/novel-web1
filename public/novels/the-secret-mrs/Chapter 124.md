Chapter 124

Late night.


Platinum Palace No.6.


On top of the bed, a golden retriever rolled around like a spinning top. "Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck…"


Lei Ming was sitting on the sofa opposite, his face one of helplessness as he yawned. "You’ve said fuck 258 times already, what on earth happened tonight?"


Immediately Adam’s eyes burned with rage, and even his tiger canines glinted coldly. "Don’t mention 250 to me! I’m really a total 250! Luna said that the last 0.1 point was deducted for my low IQ, and she was absolutely right! Fuck* fuck fuck… I’m really so stupid, there’s no cure for me! What damn use is a voice recording! Why didn't I secretly record a video! Why why why…"


Lei Ming’s mouth twitched. He had no clue at all why he was acting all crazy.


But there was one thing he understood, watching him like this. Every time he acted crazy, it had something to do with Luna. "Adam, do you want to get back together with Luna?"


Adam froze like stone, and said furiously with a heng sound, "I would be nuts to want to get back together with that asshole! It’s because of her that I still have nightmares even now!"


Lei Ming looked silently at the expression on Adam’s face, which was like a woman scorned. He clearly liked her, but still refused to admit it.


Actually, he had always suspected that back then, Adam’s play-acting had turned into real feelings for Luna. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been so angry after knowing the truth.


As for how he felt about Luna now, could it be hatred caused by love? But it could also be that what is unattainable is forever the best!


As Adam continued to roll around, his cellphone at the head of the bed rang.


Adam was not in a mood to answer it at all. In the end, it was Lei Ming who picked up his phone to take a look. "It’s your father."


"My dad?" Instantly, Adam sat up.


He and his father had fought like enemies over him entering the entertainment industry. Why would he take the initiative to call him ?


There was a faint spark of unease in Adam’s heart, and he instantly picked up the phone.


They hadn't spoken for too long, and still had unfinished business with each other, so Adam didn't greet his father, and just asked bluntly in a cold voice, "This late at night, what business does CEO Adam have with me?"


There was a helpless sigh on the other end of the line, and a man said in a tired voice, "Adam, coma back, the company’s about to collapse…"


Adam’s expression changed instantly. "What do you mean the company’s about to collapse? What happened?"


"There’s a spy in the company, and there’s been a problem in our collaboration with HN. Right now, I can’t trust anyone — the only one I can rely on is you. Don’t tell me you have the heart to just watch everything I’ve worked for my whole life be destroyed in one go?" Arlo Byron sounded like he was almost begging.


Adam gripped his phone even tighter. "I won’t leave the entertainment industry! And I’ve already told you that I won’t take over your company!"


"Adam, I’m not asking you to leave the entertainment industry, and it’s your decision whether you want to take over the company or not. I’m just hoping you can spare a bit of time to come back and help me!"


Adam was a very stubborn person, but hearing his domineering father, who was like a tyrannosaurus at home, speak to him in such a disheartened way for the very first time, there was no way he could bear it, so he didn't immediately refuse, but said vaguely, "But I’ve been very busy recently… let me think about it!"


After Adam hung up, Lei Ming immediately asked concernedly, "Did something happen at your dad’s company? Family is important, I can help you make adjustments at work."


250 in Chinese pinyin is ‘er bai wu’, which in Chinese slang refers to a stupid person.


‘Hatred caused by love’ is a Chinese idiom to describe growing to hate someone because of unrequited love for that person.
