Chapter 28

"This is the first time Little Treasure has drawn a portrait," Theo noted after glancing at the drawing Luna was holding.


"Really? Then I’m honored!" Luna was pleased.


"What do you want to eat in the afternoon?" Theo asked.


It seemed not just her living expenses, her food expenses were also covered.


Just when Luna was about to reply, her cellphone suddenly rang.


Sophia was calling.


Did she arrange another minor role for her?


"Hello, Sophia."


"Luna, the opening ceremony for The World will be held at noon at Pearl Hotel. Don’t be late."


"What? Noon? Today at noon?"


"That’s right. Today."


"Sophia, why didn’t you tell me earlier? It’s already almost eleven!"


"What do you mean earlier? Aren’t I telling you an hour early now?"


"One hour might not be enough time for me to get there, not to mention I still have to dress and do my makeup…"


"That’s your problem, not mine. I’m busy, so I’m hanging up now."


As soon as she finished speaking, the line was cut off.


"Sophia! Fuck your grandpa!" Luna threw her phone.


In the silence that followed, Luna froze.


Little Treasure froze.


Theo also froze.


Luna wiped her face, hating herself and wanting to dig a hole to hide in.


She had been too impulsive, forgetting that she was in the Goldberg residence and there was even a precious child present…


She didn’t care about acting like a well-bred lady in front of Theo, but it wouldn’t be good if Little Treasure learned anything bad from her.


"Cough cough, Little Treasure, let’s pretend you didn’t hear anything just now! You can’t copy Auntie and scold people like that, because the one Auntie was scolding isn’t even a person!" Luna explained seriously.


Little Treasure blinked a few times, and then nodded like he understood.


A flash of amusement flickered in Theo’s eyes. "What happened?"


Luna clenched her jaw. "The opening ceremony for The World is at noon. It’s nearly eleven and my manager only told me about it just now. It takes at least fifty minutes to get to Pearl Hotel from here. Am I supposed to appear on camera bare-faced?"


"Why not? You’re pretty enough as it is."


Luna was stunned for a moment. She never thought Theo would say such words, and she shook her head embarrassedly. "Cough, I thank Master Theo for his praise… but for these sort of events, it’s only polite to be dressed properly. Most importantly, I don’t have anything appropriate to wear, and there will be a lot of paparazzi there. Ahhh, so frustrating…"


"Wait a moment." Theo raised his hand to let her know not to worry, and then carried his cellphone to the courtyard to make a call.


Ten minutes later, a person rushed over, gasping for breath.


"CEO Goldberg, the things you wanted are all here. Do we start now?" The person who had arrived was wearing ripped jeans and a grey cotton top; there was a very striking dark blue piercing in his left ear.


Luna was startled to find that this person looked very familiar.


Of course, what Luna meant by ‘familiar’ was that she knew him, but he did not know her.


This was Arthur, the person under Glory World Entertainment known as the Godly Hand, and personal stylist to the queen of films, Arthur..


This was someone so famous, a small fry like her could only admire him from afar!


"This is?" Luna’s face was filled with suspicion.


"You don’t recognize him?" Theo asked.


"This is the famous Arthur, of course I recognize him! I meant why did you call him over…"


"Naturally, he’s here to style you," Theo said matter-of-factly.


Dark lines appeared on Luna’s forehead as she moved closer to whisper in his ear, "You… you would actually make Glory World’s people style me? Are you kidding! Don’t you know I’m an artiste under Starlight Entertainment? Glory World Entertainment and Starlight Entertainment are practically enemies!"


"So what?" Theo wore an overbearing CEO’s expression.
