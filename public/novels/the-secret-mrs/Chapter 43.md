Chapter 43

Or maybe it wasn’t that he had changed, but that he had hidden it too well, so she never really knew him at all.


Luna noticed bloodstains on Theo’s hand, and asked without thinking, "Theo, Theo, what happened to your hand?"


Theo looked at the delicate little teeth marks, then looked at her with a smile. "What do you think?"


Luna swallowed. "Well… these teeth marks look familiar…"


There was praise in Theo’s expression. "Good eye."


"Cough, thanks." Luna smiled awkwardly, and then asked more carefully, "Was it me?"


"You think I’m trying to frame you? You can take anther bite and see if they look the same," Theo suggested, and held out his hand.


Luna waved her hands in embarrassment. "No need, no need, it was me! I did it! Then again… what on earth happened last night? Everything’s in pieces, I only remember going to the bathroom, the rest after that is a blur… how did I end up here?"


"You blacked out in the girls’ room, I went in to get you, you didn't want to come with me and you bit me," Theo answered succinctly.


Luna was confused. " You… you went into the girls’ room?"


She had really committed such an unforgivable sin! The Big Demon King had sacrificed too much for her…


"Then why was I sleeping in the car?" Luna gathered the courage to ask.


"Because you refused to leave your little darling." Theo deliberately emphasized ‘your little darling’.


Luna looked at the car she had worshiped for so long, and understood Theo’s words immediately.


"I’m so sorry, I’ve caused you so much trouble!" Luna apologized weakly.


It was only the second night since she’d moved in, and already so much had happened, she truly felt bad about it.


Theo didn't respond to her words, and instead asked something unrelated, "Why did you get so drunk last night?"


Luna’s face suddenly saddened…


Looking at how her face changed, Theo’s inner beast started to raise its head.


Luna wasn't used to sharing her worries with others, but this weight was too much to bear; she sank listlessly into the car seat, looking at the greenery above her head, and murmured, "I didn't get the  Ella Smith role…"


Theo was surprised. "What?"


"It’s just a small second female lead role, I know a big CEO like you can’t possibly understand, but you don’t know how hard I worked for this day, you have no idea how happy I was when I got it, none of you understand…" Luna covered her eyes with her hands as she spoke.


All this time, Theo thought that she had gotten so drunk because of Liam; he never thought this would be the real reason.


She was not sad about losing Liam, but about losing the role?


Theo’s brightened after the gloom he had felt all night, but seeing Luna’s sad face, his heart clenched.


How could he not know how important her dream was to her.


She wouldn’t be so stubborn otherwise, choosing to climb up step by step even though there were shortcuts she could have taken.


"Don’t be sad, you are already doing well." Theo lifted her head to rest it on his chest.


So Liam wasn't the culprit, it was… Robert.


Robert was the biggest investor for The World, so he had a large say in whom to cast in the movie.


No one was allowed to bully his girl, not even her own father.
