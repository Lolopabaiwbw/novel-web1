Chapter 114

Adam was in a good mood as he came over to explain. "Didn’t Director David post a behind-the-scenes clip? It included the bondage scene which we shot that day. After that, they turned from being your haters into your fans. Really, is everyone so happy to see me being pushed down?"


"Uh…" So that was it.


Fans were infatuated with their stars, but very few wanted to have any interaction with them in real life, since it was too impossible. Hence, films and other media had become channels through which fans could fantasize.


If a female star was going to co-star with your male god, your first reaction might be a little jealousy. In particular, if that actress was very terrible, fans would feel that it was unfair to their idol, which would create a mood of huge resistance. But if the opposite was the case, fans would imagine themselves as the person playing opposite their idol, which was the ultimate satisfaction.


This was Luna’s current situation.


"Adam, Adam, I heard the two of you have a lot of intimate scenes, is that true? Is there a kissing scene?" A fan asked excitedly.


Adam raised an eyebrow. "Yes, there’s one today."


"Aaaah!" Immediately, there was a wave of excited screams.


"Can we watch? Can we, can we?" The girls created a racket as they asked repeatedly.


"Today’s scene will be filmed outside, you should be able to see it from the fringes, but at that distance it might not be very clear," Adam replied.


"No problem, no problem, we brought our equipment!" The girls took out binoculars, which were a must-have for a fan.


Luna was speechless.


With so many people watching, the pressure on her was going to be intense!


In the lounge.


Luna couldn’t help asking, "It's a kissing scene, but which one is it?" Because too many things had happened recently, the schedule had changed a lot. She only had a general idea and hadn't been given specifics.


Adam flipped through the script excitedly. "It’s the one of the Lantern Festival. I asked the director last night."


Luna immediately recalled the story. "Lantern Festival? Isn’t that the scene where Meng Changge and Sun Huanqing kiss for the first time?"


"That’s right, that’s the one!" After saying that, Adam approached her warily and sniffed her. "Do you remember what I said yesterday, you didn't eat anything you shouldn't have, right?"


Luna slapped him away. "Do I seem like such an unprofessional person?"


"Remember what you just said, otherwise, if you’ve cheated me, I'll tell the director!" Adam stared at her distrustfully. She had played too many tricks on him, he didn’t dare lower his guard at all.


Luna gave him a haughty look. "You’re so old already, yet you’re still playing at tattling to the teacher! Are you a kid?"


Adam snorted and turned away. "I’m not talking to you anymore, I want to study how to act in this scene!"


Luna swung his chair around. "What do you need to study? Anyway, when the time comes, I’ll be the one to force a kiss on you! Now come here, I have something to ask you!"


Adam: "…" The heck, can’t he study how to be forcibly kissed?


"What do you want to ask?" Adam said unhappily.


"How are they going to deal with Mia's role now?"


"Of course she’s going to be replaced. I heard from Brother Ming that she’ll be replaced with someone from our Glory World. It seems it’s a new singer! Her looks are not bad, but she doesn't have any acting experience at all. I don’t think she can act well. That’s right, have you heard about Mia?"


"What happened to Mia?" Luna was confused.


"What else could it be? The issue became so big that the man’s legal wife found out. She got people to strip her on the streets and beat her up, and told her to leave the capital, otherwise next time she would just kill her straight away! At first, I was still worried what that woman would do to you after being driven into a corner. Now it looks like there’s nothing to be worried about!" As Adam spoke, he felt that something didn’t seem right. "Luna, why do I feel that all this is going along too smoothly and too well?"


At this moment, the director's voice came from outside —


"Luna, Adam, get your makeup done, the next scene is yours!"
