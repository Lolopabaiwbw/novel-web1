Chapter 152

Ever since Luna came back, Little Bun had completely switched to "shadow" mode; he went where she went, keeping close to her.


Downstairs in the living room.


Cleo also had "shadow" mode switched on; he followed Theo wherever he went.


"Bro, brother, my dearest brother… the two of you… what did the two of you do the whole night?"


Theo made coffee and sat on the sofa: "We talked."


Cleo choked, as disappointed as a puppy that had not gotten its meat bone. "Fine, forget I asked."


"What progress have you made on the thing I asked you to do?" Theo asked.


Cleo instantly switched to business mode, and he answered seriously, "Things have started moving already; within a month, Martin Madrazo’s Eric Williams Real Estate will have disappeared from the capital.


"What about Luna’s issue?"


Cleo organized his thoughts, then said, "Because the production crew stopped the news from leaking, I didn't hear about it in time. As for now, there’s no way the one who set her up would continue obstructing the news, and it has spread online already. What’s worse is that the props master claimed in an interview that Luna bribed him to tamper with the prop. So now it’s no longer just a public opinion issue, if Emma files a charge, the police might take Luna away to be investigated!"


The violent currents coming off Theo could devour the whole world. The sofa under him had become the skeleton throne of the Big Demon King, and each word he spit out was like ice. "I would like to see them try."


"No no no… sister-in-law has you to support her, nobody would dare touch even a strand of her hair!" Cleo hurriedly flattered him, then said in a positive tone, "Brother, don't worry, I’ve already had someone secretly bug the props master’s house. In this period of time, he will definitely get in touch with the person behind all this. There’s no need to worry that we won’t obtain evidence, we’ll see who gets taken in by the police then!"


Theo wasn’t satisfied, and he tapped one finger on the coffee table. "Efficiency."


Hearing this, Cleo got upset, and he muttered, "This is a good idea, how is it not efficient!"


From the depths of the TV cabinet, Theo pulled out a gun and threw it directly in front of him.


The corner of Cleo’s mouth twitched. "Sheet! You’re too simple and uncivilized! You have no finesse at all!"


As they were talking, there came the sound of footsteps.


Theo silently put the gun back, then turned his head to look warmly at the person who had come in. "Is Little Treasure asleep?"


"Yes, finally!" Luna answered, then said in a rush, "That, Theo, I have an urgent matter to attend to, I need to go out for a bit, I’ve already left Little Treasure a note, my phone is fully charged, you can contact me anytime, I’ll be back in not more than three hours! That’s it, see you later!"


As soon as she finished, she ran away like the wind.


Cleo rubbed his chin. "Brother, where is sister-in-law going in such a rush?"


Theo had a contemplative expression on his face as he looked in the direction that Luna had disappeared in, then he said to Cleo: "Get someone to follow her."


For Luna to suddenly leave at this hour, there had to be more to it. He would go after her himself, but he couldn’t leave Little Treasure at home alone in his current condition.


"What get someone to do it, I’ll go!" Cleo immediately took the mission happily.


Cleo went back to his place and drove out a fairly low-key black car to follow Luna, who was driving her motorbike like a tornado on the road.


After twenty minutes, he followed Luna to a stop in front of the apartment where she had been staying before. While he monitored the activity over there, he gave Theo a real-time report.
