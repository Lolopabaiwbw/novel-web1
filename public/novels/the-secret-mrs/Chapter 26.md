Chapter 26

"Cough cough cough…" Luna felt completely defeated by Theo and hurriedly said, "I’m just kidding… it was a joke…"


It seemed as if Theo was addicted to giving away keys, as he gave her yet another one. "It’s not easy to catch cabs in this area, and going to work might be inconvenient for you, so you can drive this car."


Luna: "…"


Why…


She was only going to live here for a short time, why did she feel like a mistress?


No, that’s not right, if she was a mistress, she would be hidden away outside, not given the keys to the main residence, and even responsibility of a child…


Wow, this felt like being a newlywed…


Suddenly, she thought of the first time she’d met Theo, and how he had abruptly proposed to her…


She thought that she understood everything about men, but the one standing before her was like a computer program with a top-notch firewall that she just couldn’t hack.


She didn’t know whether agreeing to his request in a moment of sympathy and weakness was going to be a disaster or good fortune…


Little Treasure’s frame of mind that night was rather unstable, so as a precaution, Luna slept beside him on the same bed.


In the middle of the night.


The door of the bedroom was pushed open gently and silently.


Footsteps drew closer, and a man knelt by the side of the bed.


In the soft, yellow light from the bedside lamp, the woman on the bed looked like she had been patting Little Treasure before drifting into sleep, her breathing shallow and expression warm. Her soft lips were like summer cherry blossoms, and slightly parted as if in unspoken invitation…


After a while, a dark shadow encroached on the faint light as the figure of a man crept closer…


He was only a breath away — just a bit more, and their lips would touch. But abruptly he stopped himself, before leaving a cool kiss on the woman’s forehead.


Luna, we have long days ahead of us.


…


The next morning.


Luna had thought at first that she wouldn’t be able to sleep on an unfamiliar bed, but she had slept so well through the night without any dreams.


When she woke, she realized that Little Treasure was already awake.


The little guy was reading a book at her side in a serious manner, not making a single sound.


He was clearly such a good child, she really couldn’t imagine what the little bun was like when he threw a tantrum…


"Darling, good morning." Luna sat up and greeted him warmly.


Little Treasure looked up happily from his book. Though he didn’t say anything and his expression seemed unchanged, Luna could tell from his eyes how pleased he was.


Amused, Luna stretched out a hand to flick an unruly lock of hair away. "Today, Auntie doesn’t need to work, so I can keep you company!"


At her words, the little guy was so visibly happier, he even smiled a little.


Luna was practically bleeding out from all the cuteness. She couldn’t help but squeeze his little cheeks. "Darling, smile more. You are too cute when you smile!"


After showering, she went downstairs where breakfast had already been prepared.


Luna didn’t see Theo, and none of the servants mentioned anything about waiting for him to eat, so she assumed he had already gone to work.


After breakfast, Luna was worried that she didn’t really know how to take care of a child; what would she do if she didn’t care for him properly…


In the end, her worries were for nothing.


The whole morning, she was on the sofa looking at her script, while Little Treasure sat at a table next to her reading books or drawing. They didn’t bother each other, but shared a harmonious air.


The servants only appeared once the whole time to bring some dim sum and fruit. Their movements were very quiet and light, as if afraid to disturb him.


It appeared Little Treasure especially liked peace and quiet.
