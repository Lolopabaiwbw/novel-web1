Chapter 31

Director Hopper had an expectant look on his face after he finished speaking.


Naturally, the reporters turned to look in the direction Director Hopper indicated, and were all stunned silly.


Luna was wearing a magenta dress made of lace today. The cut of the dress perfectly emphasized her mesmerizing waistline, and the neckline exposed her elegant collarbone. The color was even harder to pull off than pure red. Although the design was exquisite, the dress would only look tacky or even scary on most people.


But the dress looked as if it had been made just for Luna — it made her so beautiful, she dazzled everyone.


Luna had personally felt that she couldn’t pull off the dress when the stylist had picked it out for her, and she had only been convinced after she put it on.


As expected of Glory World’s Godly Hand, his eyes were just too keen. Just one look at her and he already knew her better than she knew herself.


Although it was Luna’s first time at this type of event, she was, after all, an actress. She had taken on various roles and personas, which naturally included celebrities, so walking the red carpet was not difficult at all.


Each step, each smile, and her every action was just right. She found the best camera angles, and gave the perfect expression.


The reporters froze for a far longer time than Director Hopper had before they came back to their senses.


This… this was the actress for Ella, Luna?


A no-name rookie with no experience worth mentioning?


This… isn’t she too beautiful?!


There were no words that could describe her, she was simply stunning!


Just a moment ago, they had actually tried to push Director Hopper into declaring who was the bigger beauty between Mia and Luna. No wonder Director Hopper’s expression hadn’t seem right, they now realized how ridiculous their question was.


Before an unparalleled beauty like Luna, even an attractive celebrity like Mia was practically just another face in the crowd.


Luna posed for the cameras in the middle of the red carpet, before turning around to pick up a pen from the tray to sign her name on the wall.


Her turning around caused another wave of gasps and the sound of camera shutters.


The dress was designed to be backless; when the stylist had chosen it, the aspect had factored heavily into his decision.


Luna’s shoulder blades were too perfect; one could say that they were the sexiest part of her body, and it would be a real waste to cover them.


Female celebrities who walked the red carpet tended to especially reveal cleavage to attract attention, but Luna had taken an alternate route, elevating her far above the rest.


After burning through countless rolls of film, it was time for the interview.


The reporters today were very pitiful.


They had initially prepared questions like: "Do you think your looks are good enough for the role of a vixen like Ella?", "Who do you think is prettier, you or Mia?", "Rumor has it that you received the role through unofficial channels, what was the reason for it?"…


Now they couldn’t use any of those questions…


Anyone who wasn’t blind could tell that nothing had happened behind the scenes — her face was convincing enough.


She was the most suitable person for the role of Ella.


The reporters started asking questions.


"Miss Brown, if I may ask, the dress you’re wearing is a Johnathan Lagerfeld design, is it a custom piece?"


Luna froze.


This dress was designed by Johnathan Lagerfeld?


She had actually casually put on a dress worth millions?


Demon King Lu, can you not be so devious!


But what was even more terrifying was still to come, when the same reporter then asked, "Miss brown, was this outfit styled by Arthur?"


You can even see that?


You really have sharp eyes!
