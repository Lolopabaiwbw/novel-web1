Chapter 135

Martin heard that there was a business drinking party that night, and that Theo would be there.


He got there early and had specially made a few preparations, but as he had expected from the beginning, Theo really could not be coerced or persuaded.


Theo hadn’t even glanced at the priceless antique calligraphy painting which he had acquired with difficulty, and when he had looked at the fresh, unplucked girl that had been discreetly sent to him, it was no different to as if he was looking at a cauliflower.


Martin was feeling very anxious when his phone rang.


"Hello, what took you so long, is it all done?"


"Yes, we have her, we’re on our way!"


"Hurry up! Make sure to get her here in ten minutes! Room 808, don't get it wrong!"


"Don’t worry, we’ll get her to you on time! Tch, Boss Zhu, this girl is a knockout, even we were moved!"


"If you dare touch her, don’t even think about getting the rest of the money! I have an important use for this woman! There better not be even a single hair missing!"


…


Not far away on the opposite end, Theo checked the time on his watch, fixed his sleeves, and stood up, looking as if he was ready to leave.


At this moment, a man broke the surface of the swimming pool and tossed his hair, creating a cool and refreshing splash. He had healthy, tan skin, a beautiful six-pack above his belly button, and below it, a mermaid line that countless men enviously wanted…


The man lifted his arrogant, handsome face, and with one wet hand, grabbed Theo’s leg just as he was about to leave. He said with a dissatisfied air, "Hey hey hey, Theo, I was the one who organized tonight’s event, can’t you give me a bit of face? It’s only been half an hour and you’re leaving? And this is a drinking party, you haven’t even had a mouthful since arriving! We have so much wine and women, is there nothing that can make you stay a little longer?"


"Let go." Theo knitted his eyebrows together, and looked like he was going to break his bones in the next second.


At this moment, Cleo walked over with a glass of wine in his hand, and laughed, "Brother Jake, can't you tell my brother isn't really here tonight? He already gave you face by staying for 30 minutes!"


Jake Stew sat on the edge of the swimming pool, a rakish smile on his face. "Where could his heart be if it’s not here with me? He doesn’t have a woman!"


Cleo had the look of someone about to reveal something shocking as he humphed. "Who says he doesn’t, he will very soon!"


"What! That's too much!" Jake really was shocked, and he straightaway climbed out of the swimming pool, his face full of betrayal. "We said we’d be brothers forever, and whoever gets into a relationship first is a dog!"


Theo gave him an emotionless sideways look. "I don't remember agreeing to something so stupid."


Cleo couldn't help teasing him. "Brother Jake, as a single man, you can fool around as much as you want, but my brother has a son, and he has a responsibility to find him a mother!"


"Then who is the woman?" Jake frowned as he asked.


Theo checked his watch again, his expression clearly showing his impatience. With long strides, he left just like that, actually ignoring him completely.


"Fuck! He actually ignored me! Choosing a girl over his sworn brother!" Jake cursed behind him.


Cleo followed Theo and also took his leave; compared with a boring wine party, he’d rather see how his brother picked up girls.


"Hey hey hey, brother, are you rushing back because you want to celebrate sister-in-law’s birthday? Tell me quickly, what surprise did you prepare for her? I can give you some suggestions!"


Cleo was chattering non-stop behind Theo when a "fat ball" suddenly appeared in the corner of his eye.


"Boss Goldberg, Second Young Master!" The man’s forehead was wet with sweat. It seemed like he had rushed to catch up to them.


Cleo slowly lifted an eyebrow. "Yo, CEO Zhu! Why the rush?"


"I, I’m looking for Boss Goldberg!" Martin looked at Theo ingratiatingly, and handed him a thin, golden room key card with both hands. "Boss Goldberg, this is my small gift to you, please accept it!"


It couldn't be more obvious that he had prepared a woman for Theo in the room.
