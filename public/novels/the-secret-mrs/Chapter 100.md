Chapter 100

"Jump straight down, quickly! Don’t pretend to be a lady!" Adam urged her agitatedly.


Luna’s mouth twitched with speechlessness. Placing her hands on the sill, she jumped down from the window.


Adam immediately dragged her over, spun her around a few times to see if she had any suspicious marks on her, then stared at her with bright eyes. "Did anything happen last night?"


Luna almost passed out from him spinning her round, and she said crossly, "Adam, what's wrong with you? It’s still early in the morning, shouldn’t you still be asleep? I was sleeping so well, what could have happened to me?"


The veins on Adam's forehead popped violently. "Luna! Are you a pig? Don't tell me you don’t know how you got back here last night!"


"I really don't know!" Luna had an innocent look on her face.


Adam took a deep breath as he calmed down. He gnashed his teeth. "How is it you haven’t been sold off when you’re this stupid? Last night it was Theo who personally carried you back here!"


Luna was a bit alarmed to hear that, and immediately argued, "So what? It was definitely because darling Little Treasure was reluctant to wake me up, so he asked his father to carry me back!"


Because it was like that time in the bar. Little Treasure wouldn’t allow anyone to touch her except Theo, so she didn't think it was anything strange.


Adam was half-dead with anger. "Luna, can’t you be a little more careful? Theo obviously has a thing for you, okay?"


Luna sighed deeply, then placed her hands on Adam's shoulders, and said earnestly, "Brother, this sister is aiming for the stars, I won’t stop for the flowers or grass. Therefore, even if you kneel down to cry and beg me to become your Eldest Auntie, I won’t give you this opportunity, okay? Please stop being delusional, go back, take a shower, and sleep!"


Hearing this, Adam’s mood became very complicated. He sighed in relief, but at the same time, looked at her with confusion. "Are you really prepared to be unmarried forever? What if you meet someone you like? Miss Little Luna, your way of thinking is dangerous and no good, do you understand? Let me tell you, even though work is important, for a woman, it’s marriage that… ah—"


Luna couldn’t stand it any longer and kicked him. "Adam, are you done? Did you deliberately come here to pick on me? It looks like it’s been too long since your last beating that your body can’t stand it!"


"You just beat me up the day before yesterday!"


"Obviously I didn’t beat you enough last time. Today, this sister has to beat you into submission. Let’s see if you still dare to spout nonsense all day!" Luna rolled up her sleeves, ready to take action.


Adam covered his head and fled in terror, but he suddenly looked behind her and said, "Uncle…"


Luna smiled darkly. "Rescue? However hard you yell today, no one will come to rescue you!"


Before Luna’s devil claws dropped down, Adam shouted, "No… it's my uncle!"


Luna’s back stiffened. She turned her head mechanically, then saw Theo standing against the light, dressed in a tracksuit. Sweat was rolling off his skin; it looked like he had just finished his morning run.


Caught red-handed about to beat his nephew up, Luna racked her brains, then immediately pointed at Adam and opened her mouth. "Mister Goldberg, this person came running early in the morning to smash your house window. In the end, I found out, and I was just about to help you beat him up!"


Adam stared at her. "Shameless…"


"You still dare say you didn't!" Luna spoke in a righteous tone.


Theo reached out a hand to remove a blade of grass in the girl’s hair, then his big palm rubbed her head in a natural gesture. "Don’t be mischievous, go wash up, it’s time for breakfast."


"Yes, right away!" She made a face at Adam and ran away.


At that moment, Adam really wanted to grab Luna and yell at her: Once! Twice! Three times! Theo is so obvious, are your titanium alloy dog eyes blind?
