Chapter 59

Although Luna had proven her acting skills this time, her reputation hadn’t improved in the slightest; because she had performed too well, making people see her as a vixen, they even thought she wasn’t acting, but just portraying herself.


Director Hopper was afraid that her mood would be unstable, and went to console her before she left. "Luna, take it easy. Your second male lead will join us next month, there is more to come!"


Luna smiled bitterly. "Director Hopper, who on earth is my second male lead? You have been very secretive from the beginning, no hint of it at all. I can understand if you’re keeping it from the media as a gimmick, but can’t you tell even us?"


"I can't say it, what if someone spilled the beans? Anyway, what I can tell you is that the second male lead is a big star!" David said mysteriously.


Mia was passing by when she heard this, and she muttered with a disdainful expression, "It’s just a second male lead, how big can he be? Can he be as famous as king of the movies Ethan? Sister Emma, don’t you think so?"


Emma smiled and didn’t say anything, but it was clear that she also felt that Director Hopper was exaggerating.


Luna ignored Mia's taunt, and stuck closely behind David as she started asking questions. "Then is he handsome? You can tell me this, right? In the script, the second male lead is supposed to be so handsome that all the young ladies in the capital pretend to be sick in order to see him!"


She would have quite a number of intimate scenes with the second male lead. Not only would she have to flirt with him, there were also several sex scenes. What was more, they would always be cuddling and kissing, so it was hard for her not to care about this.


"Of course he’s handsome, I’m sure you’ll be very satisfied! When the time comes, if you don’t pass out from the excitement, that would be a surprise!"


"No way, Director Hopper, don’t trick me! I’ll take it for real!"


…


Time passed in a flash, and it was now August. She had been living at the Goldberg residence for two weeks, and her relationship with Little Treasure was getting better and better. Her work on set at the moment was also going pretty smoothly.


Emma and Mia had formed an alliance, and now and then would play tricks on her. Though she had seen through all of them, it was too tiring being wary of them every day, so she was looking for the right opportunity to defeat them once and for all.


Talking about this, it was strange, but she had the feeling that there was someone on the production team who was helping her behind the scenes. There had been several times when she had missed something, but was given very subtle hints. It was likely that there were people who disliked Mia's arrogant and domineering way of doing things. Luna didn't think too much about it.


Right now, the biggest headache for her was going to the airport tonight to meet a certain annoying guy.


The whole of today, while she was on set, that guy had continued calling her to death to remind her.


After finishing work, Luna went back to the Lu residence first because she wanted to get her equipment.


"You’re back. A nice hotpot restaurant opened recently, shall we take Little Treasure out to eat tonight?" Theo was sitting on the sofa reading a newspaper. Seeing she had come back, he asked her the question in a very natural manner, as if he was asking a wife.


Luna was surprised by her thoughts. It was only just over half a month, but she was already used to the way she and Theo got along.


The two of them, along with Little Treasure; it really did feel like they were living as a family of three.


Luna shook her head to get rid of those strange thoughts, and said awkwardly, "I'm afraid I can't tonight. I'm just about to go to the airport to meet someone, and I’ll probably be back very late. Does Little Treasure want to have hotpot? Why don’t you take him out to eat?"


"If you’re not here, he won’t go out with me."


"Cough… alright. Then let’s have it next time!"


Theo put down the newspaper and looked at her with dark, deep eyes. "Meeting a friend?"


"Well, kind of…" Luna nodded a little reluctantly.


"Man or woman?"


"Uh…" Wasn’t this question overstepping a boundary?
