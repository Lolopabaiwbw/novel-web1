Chapter 38

CEO Goldberg was lucky; because it was very late at night, there was no one else in the women’s restroom. He immediately saw that Luna was extremely drunk as she sat on the floor, leaning against a cubicle door.


She had kicked her high heels off into different directions, and the contents of her bag were spilled across the floor; her hair was hanging messily all over her face. She was a completely different person from when she had left looking flawless.


A flash of affection flickered in Theo’s gaze as he went over to pick up her bag, and one by one, collected the things that lay on the floor. He then picked up her shoes and put his arm around her waist to support her up.


Just as he was about to carry her, Luna suddenly grabbed the cubicle door, refusing to let go. She looked alarmed and entirely drunk as she stared at him. "You are…"


"Theo."


"Theo…" Luna was entranced at first, and then she abruptly bellowed, "You’re a liar! Do you think I’m stupid! This is the women’s restroom!"


Was this girl really drunk or pretending to be drunk? She seemed to still have retained some common sense.


"I’m not lying to you."


"Liar… I won’t go… I won’t go with you…" Drunk Luna was like a little hedgehog that had been scared by something, fully on guard.


Luna utterly refused to leave, so Theo could only put down her things and try to coax her. "What do I need to do for you to believe me?"


"Show me some ID!" Luna looked like a cop inspecting a drunk driver.


Theo’s lips curved into a smile, and like a good civilian, he took out his leather wallet to retrieve his ID and give it to her.


Luna held the small card shakily, her eyes practically touching the words as she read, "Theo Goldberg... you are Theo…"


Theo nodded his head. "Now can we leave?"


"I’m not leaving! I won’t go with you! You’re the Big Demon King… won’t go won’t go won’t go…" Luna became even more agitated.


"Big Demon King…" Theo’s face turned black. So that was how she thought of him. He thought that he had treated her quite warmly.


The two of them were at a stalemate, when suddenly, there was the sound of footsteps outside.


"Luna… Luna, are you inside there?"


Theo froze. If someone were to see him inside the women’s restroom, he would never be able to show his face in the capital again.


The footsteps drew closer and closer, to the point they would soon be able to see the other person’s clothes. Theo cursed under his breath, then quickly grabbed Luna’s bag and shoes and pulled her past the door she was clinging to.


The person outside the restroom was the Crew Member, Liana.


Luna was a rookie and didn’t know anyone in the film crew; only Liana noticed that she had gone to the restroom and had never come back, so she came looking for her.


Shocked after being suddenly hustled into the cubicle, Luna tried to struggle out of Theo’s embrace. Liana obviously noticed the ruckus inside.


"Luna, is that you?"


Hearing the person draw closer, Theo’s face was as black as the bottom of a pot. Just at that moment, Luna bit the hand he had over her mouth. It hurt so much that his eyebrows creased together.


Theo’s expression showed that he was on the verge of collapse. Had he ever been in a more difficult situation?


After taking a deep breath, Theo spoke in a rough, hoarse voice, "Don’t rush… I’ll give it to you now…"


Liana was about to knock on the door when she suddenly heard a man’s voice. She froze for a moment before understanding the situation, then her face went red as she quickly hurried out.


Who would have guessed she would run into a couple doing ‘business’ there?


This was a hotel, so why didn’t they get a room if they wanted to do it? It was really impossible to understand some people’s preferences!


Apart from that, the women’s restroom was empty; this Luna, just where did she run off to?


Liana never imagined that the female ‘doing business’ in the restroom cubicle was the Luna she was trying to find.


Hearing the footsteps retreat, Theo breathed out in relief.


He was sitting on the toilet, and he loosened his tie as the little woman throwing a tantrum sat on his knee. He said coldly, "Stop being so noisy!"


Or else the act will become real.


The man’s tone was so terrifying that it stunned Luna, and she started hiccuping, her small face revealing an expression of being wronged.


After scaring her, Theo helplessly started patting her back as he tried to console her. "Sorry, I shouldn’t have scared you."


But the person in his arms became even sadder, and tears began to fall from her eyes.


He felt helpless.


Why was this girl even harder to take care of than Little Treasure?
