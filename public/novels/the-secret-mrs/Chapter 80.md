Chapter 80

 After helping Little Bun change his clothes, Luna also went into her room to get changed.


Very coincidentally, she had an outfit that was very similar to Little Treasure’s. She immediately dug it out to wear, pairing her shirt with a pair of denim overalls.


When she came out after changing, Little Bun’s eyes lit up as soon as he saw her.


He looked at her, then looked at himself. His face was full of joy and satisfaction, even reaching out to touch the rabbit ears on her hood. He was clearly very happy to be wearing the same clothes as Auntie Luna.


When both of them were ready, the sound of a car’s engine could be heard at the entrance.


Theo was back.


The temperature outside was as high as 30oC, but it was as if Theo had returned from a land of glaciers and snow as he strode into the living room on long, slender legs and with a haughty demeanor.


When his eyes fell on Luna and Little Treasure on the sofa in similar clothes, as if they were wearing mother and son matching outfits, his whole body was like a glacier thawing, starting with his cold eyes…


Little Treasure’s outfit was naturally very cute. As for Luna, the cute rabbit ears and overalls made her look even younger; sitting side by side, she and Little Treasure looked more like siblings.


Seeing that Theo had returned, Luna immediately pulled Little Treasure up off the sofa. "We’re both ready, can we go?"


Theo nodded, his eyes on the girl for several seconds before he looked away. "Let's go."


In the car, Luna asked excitedly, "Hey, Theo, don't you think Little Treasure’s outfit is cute? I had to look for a long time before I found it."


"Cute." Theo replied, but he was looking at the girl in the rearview mirror.


Luna was content. "Told you so! From now on, you should buy more cute outfits for Little Treasure!"


"Mm." Theo replied, then took a black card out and handed it to her.


"What… what’s this?" Luna blinked, unable to comprehend that she was looking at the legendary Infinite Black credit card, which she had only ever seen online.


Theo: "Buy."


Luna: "Uh…"


This wasn’t what she meant, okay?


Without saying anything, you just crush me with money?


Whatever, since I already have it, I’m going to buy some more better-looking clothes for Little Treasure later!


At their destination.


Theo got out of the car first, then like a gentleman, opened the car door for them. He looked at Luna and asked, "Are you fine with it?"


After spending enough time with him, Luna had gradually gotten used to Theo’s brief manner of speaking, and knew he was asking her if she had any problems appearing in public.


Luna scratched her head. "Should be fine! Not many people recognize me now, and anyway, I'm also dressed like this!"


Saying that, she took out a pair of amber round glasses without any lenses in it. "It should be okay with this!"


"Fine." Theo nodded.


The three of them walked to the hot pot restaurant.


Luna had guessed right; truly, no one recognized her.


However, she had forgotten about Little Bun and Theo.


The father and son pair were simply too eye-catching, especially when they were together; they attracted everyone’s attention.


In fact, Luna was also very eye-catching today, because she was wearing matching parent and child clothes with Little Bun.


"Ah! Look at that father and son, too good-looking! The adult is handsome and the kid adorable!"


"The sister beside them is also very beautiful! The whole family is good-looking! Is dad taking the siblings out? Where’s mum?"


On hearing this, Theo's face darkened visibly.


Luckily just then, the man next to the woman said, "What dad and his kids! It’s a family of three, okay? That girl is obviously the man's wife and the little boy's mother!"


"No way! That girl looks very young!"


"What do you know, it’s a married couple with an older man and a younger woman. The way that man looks at the girl is different, alright? Obviously it’s the expression of a man looking at his wife!"
