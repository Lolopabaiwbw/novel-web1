Chapter 107

At first, Luna had been prepared to pay with her own money, and buy it for Little Bun as a gift. She never expected this awkward situation to happen.


She really liked this outfit, and thinking how something that was meant for Little Bun would be snatched away by someone like Aliyah, her whole body couldn’t bear it. In the end, she took out the black card which Theo had given her.


When Luna took the card out, it was the salesgirl and those two women’s turn to stare dumbly.


The salesgirl was very experienced and knowledgeable, and with one glance she had recognized the card. Aliyah and Maya had never seen the real thing before, but women in that circle were inherently sensitive to this kind of thing, so they also instantly recognized that this was the "King of all cards", only a few of which existed in the world, the legendary Infinite Black credit card.


The limit on this card was extremely high, and the annual fee was shocking, but the cardholder would receive first-class service worldwide. As a result, it wasn't available to the public, and you couldn’t apply for it. Only 1% of Platinum card holders were selected and invited to hold this card, so even the wealthy couldn’t necessarily hold it. The only ones who could obtain this card were important politicians, billionaires, or celebrities in society.


Aliyah’s face was stiff, and she hmphed coldly. "It’s probably a fake card! Miss, you have to check it properly!"


While the salesgirl had seen it before, it had actually only been once. She took the card cautiously, and then started the process of swiping it.


After ten seconds, the salesgirl instantly had a megawatt smile on her face, and she gave Luna a 90-degree bow. "Miss, you’re all set, I’ll wrap the suit up for you right away."


Luna nodded. "Thank you."


Aliyah and Maya stood there in shock. They exchanged looks, and stared at Luna like they had seen a ghost.


Luna picked up the wrapped outfit and straightaway turned around to leave.


Seeing Luna leave in her high heels, Aliyah gnashed her teeth, her face full of malice. "So what, it’s definitely because she’s become some rich man’s mistress! Does she think if she gives birth to a son, she can marry into blue blood?"


"That’s right, the real wife will definitely make her suffer to death one day!" Maya echoed the sentiment.


…


After leaving the children’s clothes section, Luna passed by the men’s section on the floor below.


Mm, that over there looked like the brand Theo usually wore.


It was totally Theo’s style, mainly in shades of black, white and grey, and looked aristocratic yet restrained.


After staring at it for a bit, her gaze fell on a newer brand which had become quite popular in recent years. Comparing them, the newer brand had more vibrant colors and trendier styles.


Luna stroked her chin, and suddenly wanted to buy some clothes for Theo.


That was women for you, they’d go out intending to just buy a pair of shoes, but in the end, come back with a pile of other things like clothes, bags and accessories.


So after buying something for Little Bun, she couldn’t help the urge to fix Theo’s style.


After hesitating for three minutes, Luna decided, buy!


So she entered the shop and straightaway bought the suit off the mannequin at the entrance, which was in the same shade of sapphire blue as Little Treasure’s clothes.


At the same time, in the CEO’s office at Goldberg Corporation, Theo, who was listening to Cleo’s reports, received two text messages.


Checking them, they were message notifications from his bank.


Luna had used his card?


A contented smile suddenly appeared on Theo’s cold face.


Seeing that expression, Cleo understood clearly. "A text from sister-in-law?"


Theo: "No."


"No?" That was strange!


Curious, Cleo approached the table for a look. Hmm, wasn’t this two message notifications from the bank? And they were expense notifications, not income notifications! Did he have to look so contented over them?


Aiya, it was really hard to understand a man who was in love!
