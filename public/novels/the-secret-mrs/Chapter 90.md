Chapter 90

Unfortunately for Mia, she had a very bad reputation in the entertainment industry, and she often did this kind of thing. Furthermore, she had been targeting Luna from the start, so no one believed her.


"Director, I'm fine, I just have a small cut in my mouth, it’ll be alright after I put some ice on it for a bit. Sister Mia might have just wanted to create a better effect, there’s no need to be angry…" Luna’s face showed that she had been treated unjustly, but that she was struggling to bear it. Her expression was one of tolerance and understanding.


Seeing that expression made not just the director, but also everyone else sympathize with her.


Adam was watching nearby, and the corners of his mouth twitched as he almost died from shock.


This person could really pretend to be a little white flower…


Seeing her frail and delicate appearance, Mia immediately blew her top. "Luna, you faker! You clearly did it on purpose! You're the one who bit yourself! Do you have a blood capsule hidden in your mouth?!"


"Mia, enough!" David rebuked her sternly.


Next to her, Mia’s assistant was afraid that the situation would get out of hand, so she hurriedly pulled her back and persuaded her, "Sister Mia, forget it! Don't make the director angry! After all, we're also to blame…"


Obviously, she also thought that Mia had deliberately hit Luna; she who was always around Mia had seen this type of thing many times.


Mia backhanded the assistant across the face. "Get lost! How is it your place to tell me what to do!"


Like Luna, the assistant also fell to the ground after being hit, and blood dribbled out of the corner of her mouth.


The staff around them, especially those who, like the assistant, didn’t have very high status, all rushed to help her up, and they looked at Mia in disgust.


Although Luna’s private life was chaotic, she had never let it affect other people, and she was committed to acting. But this Mia, simply put, was a shrew!


This was the first time that Mia had been unfairly accused. When she saw that everyone didn’t believe her, her face turned blue, as if she was going to pass out from fury in the next second.


Just as she lost control and was about to recklessly tear Luna apart, suddenly a person came up to her and grabbed her wrist —


"Mia, really, I know you want to perform well so that the director would see you in a new light, but you don't have to be so serious. People who know you will say you’re committed to your work, but what about the people who don’t understand you?"


The person speaking was Emma, who had just arrived.


Emma didn't have any scenes today, so she didn’t actually need to come. But she still came, for the purpose of seeing Luna’s hapless state. Who would have thought that she would arrive to such a scene…


What the hell was this Mia doing?


She had such good cards, how could she play them like this?


Seeing how everyone was starting to feel sorry for Luna because of the extremely loathsome Mia, Emma hurriedly stepped in to salvage the situation.


When Mia saw Emma, it was as if she was seeing her family member. She immediately took her hands and started to cry. "Sister Emma, this bitch is slandering me!"


Afraid that Mia’s big mouth would annoy people again, Emma dragged her into a corner. "Why did you lose your cool? Luna will be kicked out sooner or later, why are you provoking her now?"


Mia was incoherent with rage. "At the beginning I wanted to teach her a small lesson, but I didn't even touch her at all. She was the one who dodged it herself, and even deliberately made it look like I had hit her hard enough for her to spit out blood!"


Looking at how the director continually comforted Luna, who had a magnanimous expression on her face, Emma could immediately see what she was scheming, and hastily thought of a way to save the situation. "Mia, it’s no use if I believe you, the problem is that no one else believes you. Because you didn’t explain the situation clearly, the best thing now is for you to apologize to Luna immediately…"


Hearing this, Mia blew up. "What? Me apologize?! I won't! Sister Emma, how can you stand on her side and defend her?!"
