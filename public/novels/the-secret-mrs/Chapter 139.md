Chapter 139

"What?" Theo's nerves became tightened subconsciously.


"That piece of cloth for blindfolding…Can you use it to blindfold me again?" Luna requested in a low voice.


A look of startle flickered across Theo’s face. "Why?"


Luna said with resignation. "Because, out of sight, out of mind!"


Although the remark of Luna was very inexplicable, but Theo understood instantly. With a slight cough, he picked up the white lace cloth that had been thrown to the ground, gently covered her eyes and tied it.


The desire inside Luna’s body flamed up the instant Theo came near, so she hurried to silently read "Null is zero and sex is zero". The turmoil in her body slightly calmed down until he had a safe distance from her and her eyes became dark again.


If the one who came was a wretched sick man like Martin, but it was Theo. For her who had had APHRODISIAC, Theo was a catalyst that infinitely amplified the drug effect and could make her have lethal chemical reaction.


"Is it ok?" asked Theo.


Luna nodded. "I have another thing need to bother you. I have no strength at all. Would you please help me go to the bathroom? It’ll be ok for me to take a cold bath!"


"Wait a minute. I'll get you water first."


"Thanks."


The sound of a crash in the bathroom was clear and audible in the quiet room.


It was the same situation that her eyes couldn’t see, but she felt matchlessly secure.


A moment later, the sound of water stopped, and the sound of footsteps came into his ear.


"Can you walk?" asked Theo.


"I should be ok. Just help me up."


Theo stretched out his arm to help her up, and very considerately kept distance with her, only using arms to touch her.


After the body of Luna finally dipped into the cold water, she sigh comfortably. "Hmm…"


Theo became nervous. ""I'm going out first. If you have something, you can call me. Don't bath too long to catch a cold."


"Ok."


Theo turned away and left. His figure was in some haste and discomfiture, as if he was running away.


After going out, Theo pulled the hotel door open, and then saw a figure who fell flop in the room without being supported.


When Theo climbed up and slapped his butt, he peered into the house, behaving stealthily like a thief. "Oh, heh heh…I just worry about you…Just worry…Absolutely don’t want to gossip…"


Theo who seemed to have expected he would hide at the door said in a cold voice: "Fetch me the papers in the car."


Cleo’s mouth opened like an "O". "Brother, do you make a mistake? You're going to read papers in this case? Are you a man?"


Theo, gave him a glance flashing with knives and swords. "Need I prove to you?"


"No, no, no! You needn’t! I’ll go at once! At once!" the proving method of his brother must be a specially masculine beating.


After bringing the papers upstairs, Cleo listened to the faint sound of water, sighing with extreme grief. "What cold bath! Be decisive and be the antidote for her in person. What a waste! Too wasteful!"


Theo: "You can leave now."


"Actually I don't want to leave, actually I want to stay ~ stay with you each spring summer autumn and winter~~~" when Cleo sang, he incomparably wistfully left.


Back in the room, Theo tried hard to ignore the blurry figure behind the frosted door in the bathroom and forced himself to focus on the papers in his hand.


Well, it was rather efficient…he had read two pages for half an hour…


Just then, there came a sudden cry of Luna in the bathroom. "Theo--"
