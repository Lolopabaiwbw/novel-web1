Chapter 53

Luna froze in an awkward position, her bra half-out; she couldn’t pull it fully out or put it back on. It was the most miserable situation ever.


The worse thing was that the bra she was wearing today was custom-made, with the triangular Superman logo printed conspicuously on each side.


Theo obviously noticed the Superman print, and raised his eyebrows slightly. But being the gentleman he was, he didn't make a big deal out of it, just coughed and said, "Sorry… the door was open, so…"


He started backing out of the room.


"No worries, my fault, I didn't close the door!" Luna pulled her bra out as she answered, like nothing had happened, and hid it under the covers. She fanned herself with her hands. " Keh, it’s steaming today, you men would never understand this kind of girl trouble. That, did you need something?"


"Why are you back so late? Had a date?" Theo asked casually.


"What date! I ran into a real jerk, and talked trash for a bit," Luna grumbled, like she had been very unlucky.


Theo relaxed after hearing her absolute denial about going on a date. "I saved some food for you, take a shower and come eat."


"I can look after my own meals…" Luna felt a bit embarrassed.


"It’s just one more person."


"Um, alright."


As soon as Theo left,Luna locked the door.


The one time she forgot she wasn’t in her own home, Luna actually made such an embarrassing mistake.She needed to pay more attention from now on.


After a shower and dinner, Luna made herself comfortable in bed and started to browse the news online, while Little Bun was at the table with a thick book.


"Emma expressed her affection for her handsome, rich boyfriend in public, award-winning actor Ethan couldn't hide his jealousy"


"Emma praised Luna as the perfect combination of beauty and talent"


"Luna - No.1 Beauty in the entertainment industry"


"Ella looking stunning at the opening ceremony of The World Images"


"First day of filming for The World, Emma’s handsome rich boyfriend paid her a loving visit"


"Breaking down the number of upcoming actress Luna’s wealthy admirers, red roses piled up on set on the first day of filming Photos"


…


…


It was all normal headlines, but they gradually turned strange, like, "Luna - a secret mistress", "Who’s the money guy behind Luna?", "Luna and her multiple men", "Luna’s personal life is a mess"…


Luna had already been prepared back at the film studio, so she wasn't too upset at seeing these.


She knew that even if the incidents with Adam and YS hadn’t happened, sooner or later there would have been gossip about her public image anyway.


These tabloids used ambiguous wording and had no supporting evidence, but when repeated enough, people might buy into them eventually, regardless of whether they were true or not.


"Need help?"Theo asked.


Luna sat up with the lap-top in her arms, cradled her jaw and laughed."Big Boss Goldberg, you want to make this go away for me?"


"Can’t I?" Theo handed her and Little Treasure each a cup of milk. "Yours is low fat."


"Thanks!" Flattered, Luna accepted the cup, and then said, "Thank you for your consideration, but it’s unnecessary, I believe time will prove everything."


"I believe you," Theo said.


His words stunned Luna, and she touched her forehead helplessly. "Theo, has anyone ever told you that you are really good at Flirting?"


"Flirting?" Theo looked suspicious; obviously he didn’t know what this Internet term meant.


"Mm… it means that you know how to hit on girls!" Luna explained.


There was a smile in Theo’s eyes. "Thank you for the compliment. So does this mean that I actually pleased you?"


With that, the atmosphere turned intimate.


Luna blushed, regretting what she had said. —Watch what you say! It’s led to such a dangerous topic!


Luckily, Theo knew when to stop. "I’m going to go through some documents in my study, you two rest well, good night."


Luna: "Good night~"


Little Treasure: "…"


Though Little Bun didn't say anything,"Hurry up and leave, don’t disturb my time with Auntie Luna" was written all over his face.
