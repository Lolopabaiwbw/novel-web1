Chapter 161

Hearing this, Luna immediately pushed the embarrassment to the back of her mind. "Done? All of it?"


cccc nodded, and signaled for her to take a look herself.


At first, Luna was worried that she wouldn't understand what she was seeing, but then she realized that Theo was showing her the results straightaway without going through all the complicated processes.


The IP address of the sender showed that the email had been sent from the apartment that Emma was staying in, Regal Riveria, and that the anonymous foreign account belonged to Caleb, Emma’s assistant.


"I thought this kind of hacking only existed in TV shows! Especially for anonymous accounts, they have high levels of security, so you need to hack into the bank’s system in order to break it, it’s almost an impossible mission…" Luna was so excited she couldn’t speak for a long while. At last, she hugged Theo. "Lord Boss! You are absolutely brilliant!"


Theo: "…"


In that moment, Theo realized that he was now facing a problem.


Even if Luna did completely trust him now, she trusted him a little too much… to the point of forgetting the fact that he was a man!


To put it simply, she treated him like a good teacher and friend, even like a father, but didn’t see him as a man.


This was really a headache…


But it was also a good sign. The moment he had been waiting for was quickly approaching.


"What are you going to do with this evidence?"Theo asked after sorting out his emotions.


"There’s no rush in making it public yet, I’ll let Emma continue making a fuss. The larger the fuss she makes, the worse it’ll hit her when the time comes! I’m going to… to…"


"To do what?"


"Mm… Theo, can you help me, why do I suddenly feel like the floor’s spinning…"


At the word "spinning", Luna blacked out, and she fell to the floor with a hard thump.


"Luna —" Theo’s face changed abruptly, and he quickly picked her up.


The soft body in his arms was burning up like a fireball. He felt her forehead; as expected, it was hot to the touch.


He had noticed it a bit earlier, but had thought the heat was just his imagination. He never expected that she would really be sick.


With the person in his arms, Theo ran downstairs: "Uncle Brandon! Get the car!"


The old butler was alarmed to see what was happening. "What is wrong with Miss Luna?"


"I … don’t know." Theo’s ice mask, which hadn't changed for a thousand years, fractured.


He didn't know! He didn't know whether it was a left-over effect of the drug or if it was just a fever, or maybe Martin Madrazo had given her something?


In that moment, Theo was drowning in self-recrimination. He should have taken her to the hospital for a check-up in the first hour; not only hadn’t he done so! He had dragged the time out for so long, and made her exhausted from running up and down.


So much had happened this time, and she was under such immense pressure.He was afraid that she had now finally reached the limits of her endurance…


"Eldest Young Master, don't worry too much, it looks like Miss Luna just has a fever, how about we call the family doctor to come and take a look at her…"


In that moment, Theo was already deaf to anything anyone could say, and when the driver came around with the car, he immediately got in with the person in his arms. "To the hospital!"


Then he said to the butler outside the car, "Tell Milo Henderson to come, too!"


"Yes." The butler was helpless to do anything but obey.


If he still had the slightest uncertainty, seeing Eldest Young Master’s expression in that moment swept it all away.


This girl was most likely their future Eldest Young Mistress.
