Chapter 51

"Did you find out who they are?" Theo’s expression implied that once he knew who they were, he would kill them on sight.


Cleo knocked on the table. "That is what I wanted to tell you. Even with my intelligence network, I’m actually drawing blanks at finding out who they are. It looks like we can only wait for them to make another move before we can try again."


But the Big Demon King looked like he could kill someone now, could he actually wait until they made another move?


Theo immediately made a phone call, and said in a tone as cold as the wind coming off a glacier, "Alex, help me investigate two people."


Cleo’s face was extremely surprised. "Wow, you’re even using your Undercover Agent!"


His gossip network couldn’t be compared with his brother's intelligence network, which could dig up a person’s secret past as long as there was even the smallest clue to work with.


"Brother, I told you before, Luna’s past isn’t simple, do you believe me now? I think you should tell Alex in passing to also investigate Luna properly!" Cleo suggested meaningfully.


"That isn’t necessary." Everyone had a past that they didn't want to tell others about. He wouldn’t touch what she didn't want to be touched. If she wanted to tell him, then she would tell him.


Filming finally wrapped up at six o’clock in the evening.


The main scenes today were all of the male and female leads. There weren’t many shots of Luna, but she still had to appear in the scene, acting like a vase for the whole day.


Being a vase was also very tiring. She felt like her neck was about to break from wearing such a heavy costume, and her body was also breaking out into a rash.


After changing her clothes and getting her makeup removed, she put on a mask as she prepared to take the subway.


She wasn’t famous yet, so nobody knew her. It was very convenient to take the subway, plus she didn’t have to deal with traffic jams.


She was about to walk towards the station, when a black Maserati pulled up beside her.


The car window rolled down, and Liam smiled at her. "Luna, let me drive you home!"


Luna: "…"


Ex-boyfriend…


Why was it yet another ex-boyfriend…


Couldn’t they just let her have some peace and quiet?


"No need." Luna walked away directly, as she didn’t want to see his disgusting face.


However, Liam refused to leave, and drove slowly after her. "Luna, can we talk?"


Luna sneered. "What is there to talk about? Do you hate the fact that there aren’t enough scandals about me today? Do you want someone to take a photograph of us and send them an even bigger scandal?"


Liam frowned, a little unused to these cold words and attitude from a girl who before had listened to and done everything he said. "Luna, that’s not what I meant, I do have something important to talk to you about!"


Luna was afraid they really would be photographed if she continued tangling with him on the street.


This guy’s car was too eye-catching.


Luna looked left and right to make sure there was nobody around, then quickly opened the door and got in the car.


Half an hour later, in a room at some restaurant.


Liam called the waiter over and ordered a number of dishes, most of which were Luna’s favorites. "Luna, I haven’t seen you in a long time, so I don’t know whether your taste has changed. How have you been all these years overseas? I sent you some money, but you returned it all to me, and in the end changed your bank account number…"


"Say what you want to say." Luna put her hand against her head and buried herself in texting Little Treasure, letting him know that she would be back a little late.


Resignedly, Liam pushed a check at her.


Out of the corner of her eye, Luna gave the check for 1 million Dollar a quick glance before narrowing her eyes. "What is the meaning of this?"


Liam’s eyes became stern. "Luna, don’t do anything that you will regret."


Luna put down her phone and looked at him with a disingenuous smile. "Oh? Tell me, what did I do?"


"Then tell me, how did you get this role?" Liam said abruptly with heavy emphasis.
