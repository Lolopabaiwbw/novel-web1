Chapter 92

The staff who were watching this all showed scornful expressions:


"Is Mia retarded? Repeating the same line over and over again, even I can recite it now! You are Ella? How can you be Ella! Ella is already dead! Such a short line, how hard can it be to memorize it?


"That post said that Luna’s acting sucks, but they really should see Mia, then they will know what real bullsheet is!"


"Actually, Luna’s a good actress, do you realize that up to now, all her scenes were done after only one take? Her only NGs were because of mistakes by other people."


"You’re right! I thought she was just being herself, but she did a great job pulling off a young Ella yesterday! Even though she was teasing Adam, for some reason, it didn't make me feel uncomfortable; instead, it actually made my heart speed up!"


"That’s right, that’s right! I was so excited watching it yesterday. If someone else is switched in, I wouldn't be happy about it at all! It feels like in my heart, Luna really is Ella!"


…


Emma hadn’t expected that an even worse situation would occur, and she immediately cursed Mia hundreds of times in her heart. On the surface, she pretended to show concern as she walked over to her.


"Mia, what happened? Are you not feeling okay today?"


Mia was caught up in her anger, and going crazy. "I also don't know what’s wrong with me today; when I look at Luna, my mind just blanks out, like I’ve been cursed!"


"How is that possible?" Emma actually didn't believe Mia, and assumed it was because of her own normally bad acting and laziness. However, she held on to her patience and comforted her. "Take it slow, I’ll run the lines with you!"


Emma ran the scene with her, and in the end, Mia recited the lines fluently.


"See, you can do it, right?" Emma encouraged her.


Mia immediately regained her confidence, and ran to look for the director. "Director, I’m ready now!"


During this time, David had calmed down, and his expression was more relaxed. "Then let’s start!"


However…


This time, Mia still forgot all her lines.


She was unsatisfied, and tried again and again; in the end, she continuously NGed 28 times in total!


It was such an easy scene, yet the two of them filmed until night fell, and still weren’t done. In the end, the whole production crew wound up complaining.


They were filming a movie, not a TV show, and had to use a lot of film. That many NGs was a waste of manpower and money!


By the 33rd NG, Mia stood there blankly, then suddenly screamed like a maniac, and rushed furiously at Luna —


"Luna, you b*tch, what did you do to me! Why can’t I remember my lines?! Why?! It’s you! You did this…"


All the assistants waiting by the side quickly ran to pull her away, but in her madness she pushed all of them off her, even scratching Emma, who was trying to help.


This really made everyone hate her.


"She is such a retard, still able to blame others for the fact she can’t remember her lines? Does she think other people can drill into her brain to steal her lines? She doesn’t even feel the least bit guilty for making everyone work so late!"


"Poor Luna, to have provoked someone like that!"


"Don’t you think what happened last night was pretty weird? This thing happened to Luna as soon as Adam came on set!"


"If Luna was kicked out of the production, who would benefit the most?"


"Do you still need to ask?"


At these words, everyone had knowing looks on their faces.
