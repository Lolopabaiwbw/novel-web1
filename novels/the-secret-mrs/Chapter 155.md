Chapter 155

Cleo was about to break into the room to rescue her, when he saw the situation inside flip 180 degrees, and he just stood where he was, stupefied.


"Single-handedly… and even with a gun! Holy sheet! If I’m right, that’s a Beretta 92F! Where did she get that from?" Cleo was impressed.


Then a miserable thought floated through his mind after that: his second chance today to become the hero who saved the beauty had fallen through yet again!


Inside the house, Jack stared intently at the gun in Luna’s hand, afraid that she would fire at the slightest provocation like earlier. She left him no leeway to react at all, how cruel!


"I, I, I… I’m telling the truth! Every single word is true! Otherwise, may the heavens strike me down with thunder and lightning!"


Luna didn't say anything, and he didn't know if she really believed him or not. She spun the gun in her hand skillfully.


My little grandaunt! Please don't set it off accidentally!


Jack almost pissed his pants as he watched, and he asked nervously, "Do… do you want me to create false evidence by naming someone… if you want me to say it’s Emma, Then Emma it is! Without conditions! I’ll do whatever you say unconditionally! It is whoever you say it is!"


False evidence?


She wanted concrete proof!


Luna pointed the tip of her gun at his chin and said, "Give me the number of the bank account that the other party sent you the money from, and the email you received."


"Okay, okay, it’s all in my computer, I’ll go and get it! But the email was anonymous and it was a foreign bank account, so it might be useless to you…" Jack grabbed a laptop out from under his covers, and showed her the email and all the details of the money transfer.


Luna glanced over everything to make sure there were no issues, and said, "This laptop belongs to me now, do you have a problem with that?"


Jack shook his head quickly, "No, no, Grandaunt is free to take it! Whatever you want to take, just take!"


Luna laughed coldly. Heh, she jumped all the way from big sister to grandaunt.


This kind of asshole wouldn't listen to reason, and if you gave him an inch when discussing conditions, he would take a mile.He was even more deceitful than you could hope to be at playing tricks, so the only way to deal with him was to fight fire with fire.


After returning to China, this was her first time using this gun. There was no way she wasn’t nervous, but she was a good actress, and as long as she pretended she was acting, she could instantly calm down.


She just picked the role of a murdering psychopath to play, looks like things turned out nicely.


Acting was her passion and her career, and also the means by which she protected herself.


"Then, Grandaunt, is there anything else?" Jack realized that she wasn't leaving, and he swallowed nervously.


Luna looked at him like she was thinking of cutting him into pieces. "Mm… let me think…"


"Think… think about what?"


"Of course I’m thinking… whether I should kill you to silence you. What if you turn around to tell other people that I forced a confession out of you?" Luna said in a matter-of-fact tone, her expression deadly serious.


Jack’s legs gave way and he fell to his knees again. "I wouldn’t! I wouldn’t dare no matter how much courage I have!"


He really was telling the truth, for he was the type to bully the weak and fear the strong, and this time Luna had really scared him out of his mind.


He had never expected that such a gentle and delicate-looking little girl could actually be this frightening. He didn't even dare look into those sinister eyes, for fear he would have nightmares.


Luna laughed lightly, and patted his cheek with the gun. "Don’t worry, not only will I not kill you, I’ll even send you money."
