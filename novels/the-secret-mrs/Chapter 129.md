Chapter 129

Liam and Emma went back to the dressing room, the two of them feeling frustrated.


Emma stood in front of him, at a loss. Tears fell from her eyes. "Brother Liam, do you blame me? Blame me because I couldn’t agree to Luna’s request."


Liam lovingly reached out to wipe away her tears. "How could I blame you!"


Emma immediately jumped into his arms, as if she had been redeemed. "Brother Liam, thank you. Thank you for believing me and understanding me. It’s not the Brown family's wealth or rank that I can’t let go of, but I just can’t leave father or mother. At the thought of leaving them, at the thought of never seeing them, I…"


"Hush, don't cry. I know, I know everything…" Liam patted her gently on the back and sighed. "I was too naive to think that she was the same as before. Emma, I promise you that from now on, I won’t let you be mistreated again because of her, and I won't let her hurt you ever again!"


"Brother Liam…" Emma looked infatuatedly at the man in front of her. She put her satiny arms around his neck, and kissed him.


"This is the production set, if someone sees us…"


"So what if they see? You are my boyfriend!" Emma pouted playfully as she sat directly on his lap. She placed her fingers on his chest and undid his buttons one by one.


Heh, Luna, I'm going to sleep with your man, take that…


A moment later, amorous gasps came from the dressing room.


"Hmm… ah! Brother Liam, you’re amazing! Hard! A little harder…"


"Brother Liam, between me and Luna, who do you think is better? Hmm? Who's better?"


"You, of course!"


In terms of looks, Luna had an edge, but she was too bashful and timid. In particular, she knew absolutely nothing about sex, let alone think about actively doing something to make him happy.


At first, he had actually liked how pure and simple she was compared with other girls, but it became too boring over time.


But the current Luna was a completely different person to her old self; instead, she was just like…


Like an alluring spirit…


While her personality had become so terrible and so unreasonable, it was impossible to look away from her…


The man’s gasps became more urgent, and in the last moment, it was that indifferent half-smile that he saw in his mind…


"Sister Emma, filming is going to start soon, can I call the makeup artist to come in and do your makeup for you?" The assistant’s face was red as she stood awkwardly outside the door.


She had gotten used to such things after being with Emma for so long.


What fresh and pure virgin…she was clearly a sex fiend. People should listen to how wanton the goddess of their heart was in bed…


Luna had already been ready since early on, but she had to wait for half an hour before Emma finally strolled over.


"I’m sorry to have kept everyone waiting, but my skin isn't very good today, so it took a while to get my makeup done," Emma explained apologetically in a hoarse and languid tone. She looked at Luna with a slightly smug and goading air. When she walked past her, she deliberately pulled at her collar, revealing a red kiss mark on her neck.


Her face was flushed, her eyes sparkled, and there was a sweet scent on her, as if she was afraid no one could tell what she had just done.


The veins on Luna’s forehead bulged slightly. If it wasn't because they were shooting a scene, she didn't want to breathe the same air as her for even a minute, she was just so disgusted.


David clapped his hands. "Alright, since everyone is now here, let’s get started! Everyone take your places, ACTION!"
