Chapter 77

Adam’s interrogative tone made Luna uncomfortable, and she knit her eyebrows together. "So what if I am? So what if I’m not?"


Adam paced angrily in a circle, then glared at her. "Luna, you really want to get yourself killed. You even dare to play games with Theo, aren't you afraid you’re playing with fire?"


"I’m happy to play with fire, what’s it to you?" Annoyed at Adam’s words, Luna’s attitude also turned bad to match his.


"You…" Adam almost got carried away by his anger, and in the end he punched the pillar behind her. "Luna, I’m not trying to scare you, I’m giving you a friendly reminder, otherwise you won't even know how you died when the time comes! Don't you know who Theo is? You think he’s the same as all those fobs you dated in the past?"


Luna rolled her eyes. "Do you think I’m an idiot? Of course I know!"


"Then why are you still…"


"Still what? What’s it to you if I’m sleeping with Theo?"


"You…" Adam slowly calmed down; actually, deep down, he knew that Luna wasn't silly enough to do that, so he tried to curb his anger, and took a deep breath. "Then tell me, what is going on?"


Luna also knew she was being childish, bickering with Adam. It was just that she had just been too provoked by seeing this person today, and she was so irritated that the smallest thing set her off.


Luna also calmed down, and explained, "I saved Little Treasure previously."


Adam was a little shocked. "You saved Little Treasure? What happened to Little Treasure?"


"About half a month ago, Cleo took Little Treasure to a bar. In order to escape the noisy crowd, Little Treasure accidentally hid in the storeroom, and the staff locked him in without knowing he was there…"


Adam gaped slightly. "Cleo took Little Treasure to a bar? That does sound like something that my unreliable second uncle would do. And then? What did that have to do with you?"


"That time, I was preparing to go to the The World audition, but Sophia locked me in the same storeroom to stop me from going…" Luna briefly explained what happened after that.


Adam patiently listened to the end. "OK, I understand now, you got to know Theo because you saved Little Treasure. Then what should have happened next is the Goldberg family giving you a huge compensation as thanks, and then GAME OVER, the two of you go your separate ways! Why are you still in touch with Theo? You even moved into his house!"


Luna had omitted the part about Theo wanting to repay her with his body. "Because Little Treasure suffered a shock and I saved him, he’s very reliant on me, so Theo asked me to stay at the Goldberg residence until Little Treasure’s condition is stable again. I have to be prepared at any time to act like a sedative for Little Treasure, understand?"


Hearing this, the anger in Adam’s expression finally started to fade, but he still felt a little uneasy. "Are you sure that’s all? So many women want to marry into the Goldberg family, and right now, you’re in the position with the best chance to do so. Do you really have no designs on him?"


Luna lifted an eyebrow, and said half-jokingly, "If we’re talking about that, I do have designs on Little Treasure; he’s just too cute, I want to kidnap him home to become my little sweetheart!"


Adam looked at her speechlessly, then touched his forehead. "Anyway, it’s best that you don't think about things you shouldn’t be thinking about, powerful families are not what you think they are!"


Luna laughed coldly. "As if you know what I think about powerful families."


She hated those people in the upper-class circles the most, who only pretended to be civil and wore fake masks…


It hadn’t been easy to leave the Ning family, why would she jump into the fire pit again?
