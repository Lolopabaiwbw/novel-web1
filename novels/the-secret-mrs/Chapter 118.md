Chapter 118

Luna was too lazy to type, so she directly sent a voice message. "Mister Goldberg, the production crew is having dinner together tonight, can you please let Little Treasure know, and tell him not to wait for me to eat."


Very quickly, her phone buzzed with Theo's reply, which was also a voice message.


Luna opened it, and Theo’s clear and caring tone came through the phone. "Okay, have fun."


"Luna..." Next to her, Adam gloomily said her name.


"What?"


"You’re not just blind, are you deaf,too? Don't you think there’s something wrong with the way my uncle talks to you?"


"Adam, do you want to get beaten up again?"


"…" Adam resolutely stayed silent. Hehe, Luna, you just wait. By the end of tonight, I’ll definitely find evidence to convince you! Con. Vince. You!


Pearl Hotel.


This time, basically all the people in the production came to the dinner party. Even Emma and the others who had had no scenes today came.


One after another, everyone welcomed Adam, and the atmosphere in the room was very warm.


After three rounds of drinks, Amy suddenly picked up a glass of wine and stood up. "Luna, I misunderstood you before. This toast is to you, take it as my apology as well as my thanks!"


"You’re too kind, Sister Amy!" Luna drained the wine in the cup she was holding.


All the people cheered. After that, many people came over to drink a toast to Luna, and she didn’t refuse any of them, as if they were resolving all hard feelings with wine.


Seeing Luna get along well with the people on the crew, Emma smiled slightly with a satisfied expression on her face. "Just as I said, there’s no way little Junior Sister can be that kind of person!"


Towards the end of the meal, suddenly a slender figure knocked at the door and came in.


"Aiya, it’s Young Master Johnson!"


"Young Master Johnson is here!"


"Brother Liam, why are you here?" Seeing him arrive, Emma immediately went to greet him, her face full of surprised happiness.


…


In one corner, a drunk Adam immediately regained his senses. His eyes burned like torches as he glared at the man in the doorway who was wearing a white suit and displayed a courteous manner.


Liam!


So that was Liam?


The only man it was said that Luna had ever loved?


Liam the perfect boyfriend would show up every time Emma needed backup. At the moment, Emma held on to his arm, and his face was kind as he said hello to everyone. "I invited some friends to eat here, and heard from Emma that all of you were also here. You can order whatever you want, and put it on my tab!"


Everyone cheered:


"Wow! Young Master Johnson’s too rich!"


"It feels like we’re always benefitting because of Teacher Ning!"


"Then we’ll help ourselves!"


…


At this moment, there came a cold snort from the corner. "Why should I let you pay for my dinner party? I'll pay for it!"


This was probably the battle of jealousy between exes. When Liam appeared, Adam hadn’t bothered to disguise his hostility.


A man was always very sensitive to another man’s hostility. From the beginning, Liam had already felt that Adam wasn’t very friendly towards him, but he still had a warm smile on his face as he spoke steadily. "Since this is a reception banquet for Mister Jiang, it stands to reason that Mister Jiang shouldn’t be the one to pay for it himself."


"That’s right, let us treat you! You can regard it our duty as hosts," Emma echoed.


What duty as hosts! I’m capital born and bred, okay? Why do I need you to perform a duty as the host?!


As Adam was about to drunkenly blow his top, next to him, Luna subtly gripped his shoulder behind him, and drew close to his ear. "Are you retarded, he’s a sucker with more money than sense, why wouldn’t you use him? Let him pay!"


Adam's face turned even uglier."Hmph, are you sure you're not defending him? He’s your ex-boyfriend, after all!"


Luna raised an eyebrow. "Aren’t you also my ex-boyfriend?"
