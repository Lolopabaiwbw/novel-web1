Chapter 27

Standing in a corner, the old butler silently observed the two people, one big and one small, inside the living room.


He realized that Luna was not behaving as he had imagined she would. He thought that she would desperately do anything to win the young master over, but instead she spent the entire morning reading her script.


Meanwhile, the little young master was reading his books and drawing as usual. Nothing much was different, but if one observed carefully, they would realize he would occasionally glance at Luna, and he would then appear vibrant and at ease.


Women who are too beautiful easily cause others to feel insecure, which was why when the old butler had first seen Luna, he had been worried and afraid that the eldest young master had been deceived.


From his observation so far, she wasn’t doing anything inappropriate, but she could just be biding her time…


So many women in the city were covetously eyeing the position of Missus Goldberg, scheming many ways to become Little Treasure’s stepmother.


Two years ago, that horrible incident even happened because of this, and little young master…


So when he saw for himself that this woman had gained the eldest young master’s trust, that the second young master wasn’t intervening in their affairs, and that even the little young master seemed to really like this woman, he decided to be on his guard against her. He couldn’t help but be cautious.


Unknowingly, two hours passed.


Luna was pretty much done with her script when Little Treasure also finished his drawing, which he brought over to show her.


Luna lifted her head to look, and was surprised. "This… this drawing is me?"


One really couldn’t tell that while Little Treasure seemed calm and quiet in nature, his preferred drawing style was fauvism.


Fauve artists tended to enjoy using bright and heavy colours with straight and heavy strokes, creating vibrant and powerful artworks expressing their emotions and passion.


Although the person in the drawing looked a little strange, it captured all her important aspects, so Luna could immediately recognize herself.


Little Treasure nodded as he gripped the drawing nervously, as if scared she wouldn’t like it.


"It’s… so beautiful! Can I take a picture of it to use as my phone wallpaper?" Luna was not trying to purposely flatter Little Treasure — these were her true feelings. She had always particularly loved art in the Fauve style for the vibrant contrast in colors. Looking at Little Treasure’s drawing with her basic understanding of art, she felt he was already a master in the style!


Little Treasure felt shy as he pressed his lips together and gave her the drawing.


Luna pointed at herself. "You’re giving it to me?"


Little Treasure nodded his head.


"Thank you! I love it so much!" Luna hugged Little Treasure and kissed him on his soft cheeks.


Little Treasure froze briefly before his little face started to blush red. His blank, sullen eyes finally sparkled with some life.


During this warm exchange, Luna heard footsteps from above.


She turned her head to see Theo slowly coming down the stairs. He was wearing casual home clothes and his hair was messy, most likely from having just woke up.


Theo’s usual appearance was already very mesmerizing, but the gap between his current dishevelled look and his usual image was so large that the impact was even more powerful. He was so sexy, there was no cure for it.


Luna felt dazed for a moment before coming back to reality. "Mister Goldberg, you didn’t go to work today?" Wasn’t today a Monday?


"Yes, I took the day off." Theo nodded his head.


Luna thought it was understandable. He had just signed a major deal which had taken a lot of effort to secure. It was natural to take a break after that.


So even Big Boss Goldberg knew how to sleep in. Suddenly, the distance between them seemed to shrink a bit…
