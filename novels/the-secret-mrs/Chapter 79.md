Chapter 79

After work wrapped up, Mia finally found an opportunity to make a move. The best thing was that Luna wasn’t around, so she approached Adam with a shy expression. "Brother Adam, where shall we go eat? How about we go to Rivers Hotel for seafood? My father is a member there, we can use the VIP room!"


Adam stretched dispiritedly "Forget it, I’m not going, I’m too tired today!"


Hearing this, Mia was worried. "Ah? But it’s your first day on set, we should celebrate with a meal no matter what!"


Adam's face darkened slightly. "Who makes the rule we must have the welcome meal on the first day? If you want to eat it so much, just go yourself!"


In fact, everyone knew that in private, Adam didn’t really have a good temper.


If he was in a good mood, then he would be very good-natured. If he was in a bad mood, then…


This brat was obviously in a bad mood right now.


Shocked by his outburst, Mia’s eyes instantly turned red. "I just thought it was the polite thing to do. Brother Adam, how can you say that…"


Who the fuck is your Brother Adam?


Adam was annoyed and about to explode. David next to him saw that the situation was starting to deteriorate, and quickly intervened. "Maybe some other day. Adam is really too tired today. I should have let him rest and familiarize himself with the environment on the first day, who knew we would end up shooting so many scenes. Everybody go back early today and rest, we’re not in a hurry to have the dinner party!"


"Alright…" Given an out, Mia reluctantly nodded, and at the same time hated Luna even more in her heart. It was Luna’s fault for occupying Brother Adam all day and making him so tired that he didn't even want to eat!


Mia bowed her head and secretly flipped through a few photos in her phone, before she smiled viciously.


You just wait and see, Luna! I’ll make you pay!

"I'm back, darling!" Once Luna was home, all of the day’s exhaustion was completely swept away.


Hearing her voice, Little Treasure deng deng deng ran to meet her, a glass of cold fruit juice in one hand.


"Darling, you’re too sweet! Love you!" Luna took the glass and drained it in one go. Then she said happily, "Come here, Auntie’s going to get you changed into a cute outfit, we’re going out to eat hotpot later!"


The little bun, who before would run to the attic upon hearing he would be going out, obediently allowed Luna to take him upstairs.


In the bedroom, he then allowed her to dress him up in one outfit after another.


"This one’s too plain, this one’s too dull, this one’s too unimaginative… my god! Who bought these clothes for you? What kind of taste is this! No need to ask, it was definitely your father! Did he forget you’re only five, not thirty-five?"


While Luna mocked Theo, she continued rummaging around, and at the bottom of the cabinet, she finally found a satisfying outfit. "Wow! This one is cute!"


It was a little white short-sleeved shirt with a hood that had two long bunny ears coming out of it, with a matching pair of dungarees that had a big pocket in the front like Doraemon.


"Looking at this style, it was definitely your second uncle who bought you this one! At least he’s somewhat reliable in this, little kids should wear cute and bright clothes!" Satisfied, Luna nodded, then asked, "How is it, darling? Do you like this one? If not, Auntie can look for another one for you!"


Luna didn’t forget to ask Little Treasure for his opinion even though Little Treasure always agreed with her.


Sure enough, Little Bun nodded without hesitation.


So Luna happily helped Little Bun put on his clothes.
