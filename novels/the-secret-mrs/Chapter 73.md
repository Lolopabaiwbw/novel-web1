Chapter 73

The girls who were watching on set started going crazy again.


"Ahhh! Adam bondage play! In my dreams I want to tie Adam up and throw him onto the bed!"


"What are you so excited about, you’re not the one going up there later!"


"I’m so mad! So mad! Why does it have to be that hateful vixen?!"


"Seriously, it sucks, can't Adam tell the director to switch her out? She doesn't deserve Adam at all!"


…


"Ahem…" David coughed to signal for everyone to be quiet, then he clapped his hands and shouted, "Okay, everyone get ready! Three, two, one, action!"


Luna was not the slightest bit affected by the talk around around her. At the director’s words, Luna’s eyes suddenly changed.


They were the eyes of a 16-year-old girl, clear and lively. The lazy, devil-may-care expression on her face was also perfect.


She lifted the hem of what she was wearing, raised one foot, and kicked open the door to her room.


The camera then cut to Adam.


Seeing the young man with his hands and feet tied, lying on top of the red covers of the bed, the color making his face look paler and weaker, really made people want to ravish him.


Hearing the kick at the door, Eden slowly opened his eyes, and looked dazedly at the girl approaching the bed, silhouetted against the light.


Ella sat down beside the bed, and from her bosom, she plucked out a small bag made from oil paper. "Sugar-fried chestnuts from the Fuxing building, I had to queue for an hour to buy them. Want any?"


Eden turned his head away and closed his eyes, refusing to respond.


Ella peeled a chestnut and tossed it into her mouth with a twinkling smile. "Not eating? Then I'll feed it to you! And I’ll do it in a way that might make you shy…"


"You…" Eden immediately opened eyes that were filled with three parts anger and seven parts humiliation. "How can you be so shameless as a girl?!"


Ella slanted him a sideway glance and raised her eyebrow. "Shame? What use is shame? Can shame slay your enemies, or get you a daughter-in-law?"


Eden's face was full of indignation. "The Smith family has been loyal for generations, your ancestors always fought on the frontlines, but you… you spend your days being a good-for-nothing and a tyrant, how can you face your ancestors?"


Ella had already heard too much of this sort of talk from the people around her, and she stuck her fingers in her ears. Then she said loudly around the chestnut in her mouth, "You’re so old and you’re still unmarried; among the three ways to be unfilial, having no sons is the worst. Can you face your Eden ancestors?"


Eden was infuriated by her twisting his words back on him, and said sternly, "This and that are two different things. Moreover, I have an ambition beyond this!"


Ella braced herself on the edge of the bed with one foot and lashed Eden over and over again with a whip she held in one hand. Finally, she lifted his chin in a gesture that was neither soft nor rough. The expression on her face was like that of a little, cunning, naughty fox. "Doctor Eden, what about this? I’ll be your wife. When I become your wife, then I’ll listen to everything you say. If you want me to go east, I won’t go west. If you want me to learn to be good, I’ll also obediently listen to you. This way, won’t we all be able to face our ancestors?"


Eden was stunned, and a flash of urgency slipped over his face. "You… don’t talk nonsense!"


Ella looked like she had discovered a new world. She drew closer to him until she was almost right up in his face. "Hmm? Doctor Eden, you’re blushing! You actually like me, don't you? So why don’t we do something that cannot be undone?"


"Cut —"


Until the director yelled "cut", everyone had been full of anticipation. Why did they stop, why don’t they continue?! We want to keep watching! We want to see what cannot be undone, done!
