Chapter 153


When Luna returned to her apartment, she immediately pulled out a metal suitcase from the bottom of her big closet, then she carefully checked and cleaned its contents.


Taking a look at the time on her cellphone, Luna threw everything into her bag, then rushed downstairs.


Not far away, Cleo was reporting to the person on the other end through his Bluetooth headphone as he drove: "Luna went back to her apartment, and came back down in less than five minutes. We are currently on This Road, headed towards the outskirts…"


After half an hour, Luna finally stopped.


Cleo looked at the dilapidated houses around him in shock. "Sheet, isn't this where the props master lives? Why did Luna come here all alone? Don’t tell me it’s to reason with him? That’s just too na?ve!"


"Turn on the monitor."A cold male voice came through the Bluetooth headphone.


"Oh oh, right, I almost forgot!" Cleo hurriedly grabbed his laptop from the backseat.


"Brother, wait a sec, let me broadcast it through my phone for you!"


Before Cleo finished speaking, he suddenly realized that he had lost control of his computer, and he was instantly dumbfounded. "Brother, you actually hacked my laptop… I already said I would use my phone to broadcast it to you! Can you not be so impatient!"


…


Jack Garcia’s wages in the production crew were pretty good, but because he was a gambler, he had no savings and had a lot of debt, which was why he was living in these slums on the outskirts.


Luna had heard all this when he was drinking and talking with the other people on set.


Dong dong dong, Luna knocked three times.


There was no sound from inside.


Luna kept knocking, until she heard a bang from inside, accompanied by the sound of slippers on the floor. The rusty iron door was pulled open from inside noisily.


"Who the fuck is it! Want to die first thing in the morning…"He was mid-speech when he properly realized that the person at the door was Luna, and his expression changed abruptly.


"Teacher Jack, I trust you’ve been well since we last met." Luna smiled and looked at him.


Jack was going to close the door straightaway, but then he thought of something, and changed his mind. He said in a lazy tone, "What a surprise! It’s Big Beauty Brown! Come in!"


A fetid odor overwhelmed Luna as soon as she entered. It was the stench of alcohol mixed with smelly socks and the odor of mold, as deadly as the smell of canned herring from that morning.


"Make yourself at home." Jack lit a cigarette, then his muddy eyes were glued to Luna’s body, sweeping over all her aspects impudently.


Luna sat on what was probably the only clean chair in the house, and immediately got right to the point. "Let me be clear, I’m sure Teacher Jack knows why I’m here. I need your confession, please explain the truth, that Emma was the one who directed and acted out her own little show, and that I wasn’t the one who set her up."


Jack laughed after hearing her words, as if he saw through her. "Little girl, are you recording this? Do you want to trap me? Hehe, you are too na?ve! Sorry, what I told the reporter was the truth!"


Jack was a like a dead pig which wasn't afraid of being scalded by boiling water, and a shrewd light flashed in his eyes. "Unless, you can offer a better price…"


Luna narrowed her eyes slightly; she had already expected this from the beginning.


After taking Emma’s money, Jack wouldn’t run, he would just continue gambling, and most likely lose everything again in the end.


Now, he even wanted something from both sides!


‘A dead pig unafraid of being scalded by boiling water’ means that a situation is so bad that making it worse would make no real difference.
