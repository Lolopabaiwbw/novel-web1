Chapter 167

"Eh, so our cooperation is considered confirmed?" Luna was still a little dumbfounded.


"I think highly of you, while you already have your heart set on Glory World. Our feelings are mutual, so is there an issue?" Theo replied with a question.


"…" Our feelings are mutual, this phrase could even be used like this…


Luna felt that she could trouble anyone in the world except Theo, which was why she asked in an extremely solemn tone, "You don’t need to think things over again? I feel that I’m rather troublesome, and if by chance, I bring trouble to you…"


"If you could handle everything so well on your own, then what would you still need a management company for? That’s the purpose of my existence."


"Oh…" Luna rubbed her nose.


Anyway, she had already noticed that the Great Demon King normally said very little, but when he did speak, each word was a gem. She could not win against him.


Luna thought carefully for a moment. Up until now, Starlight had wronged her so many times, so it would be considered normal for her to suggest dissolving their contract. She wouldn’t be creating any reason for gossip, and even her termination fee would be taken care of. Clearing her name was only a small issue, so it shouldn’t particularly trouble Theo.


Thinking of it like this, she finally relaxed.


"Lord Boss, to repay your kindness, from now on I will work hard to earn money for you. I won’t disappoint you!" Luna immediately expressed her heartfelt sincerity.


At the very least, she was very confident in her own capability!


Theo smiled. "Yes, I look forward to it."


At this moment, Luna’s cell phone suddenly rang.


The display name was Evil Fairy King.


Adam had called countless times, but because she had been too busy and had suddenly fallen ill, she had never managed to pick up his calls.


Luna didn’t hide it from Theo, and directly answered, "Hello, Adam…"


Not waiting for her to speak, a roar so loud that her eardrums almost exploded came from the phone —


"Luna, where in hell have you roamed off to! Do you know that you’re being bad-mouthed by everyone!


He went to the Goldberg residence once to find her, but the butler had informed him that she wasn’t there, and neither was Theo. That day happened to be her birthday, and with the two of them missing, how could he not overthink it!


Luna wordlessly pulled at her ear. "What do you mean ‘roam’! I’m currently in the hospital!"


Adam froze when he heard this, and his voice immediately became frantic and nervous. "What? In the hospital? Are you okay? Don’t tell me you got beaten up?"


Luna curled her lips. "You’re the one who was beaten up! It’s just a fever!"


"Which hospital are you at, I’ll come see you right now!"


"No need, you’re so busy. You should just worry about the stuff at home first. My fever has already gone down, and Theo is here, not to mention, Little Treasure will be coming soon."


The cell phone suddenly went silent for a few seconds, and then Adam spoke in a somber tone: "Luna, have you seen the email I sent you yet?"


"Not yet, I haven’t had the time. Ever since the day before yesterday, I haven’t been able to take a break from all the problems! In short, there’s too much to talk about, I’ll tell you everything later when I have the time."


Adam took a deep breath. "Just remember to take a quick look. Also, let me ask you, what are you going to do about Emma? Originally, I was prepared to help you deal with Jack Garcia that bastard, but in the end, when I sent someone over to stop him, his place was already empty. Because you belong to Starlight Entertainment, I can’t use my company’s public relations department, so I’ve discussed with Brother Ming and personally contacted a reliable public relations team…"


When Luna heard this, she gratefully replied, "Thank you Adam, but there’s no need. I’ve found evidence to clear my name."


Adam ground his teeth. "Was it Theo AGAIN?!"
