Chapter 145

"What is it?" Luna tilted her head.


Was it because he liked her, so no matter what she did, he thought it was cute? Theo couldn't help touching her little head lovingly. "Do you like diamonds?"


"Ah?" Luna hadn’t expected that he would suddenly ask such a strange question. "Why do you ask?"


"Today is your birthday, Little Treasure helped me prepare a birthday gift for you. It seems he picked out diamonds. I’m helping him ask in case you don't like it." Theo acted normal.


"So it’s like that…" Luna scratched her head, then said, "Well, diamonds are supposed to be a girl’s best friend, right? But it’s just a birthday, and he’s a little kid, he shouldn’t be getting me something so expensive, so I’ll have to say no. Something handmade would be better!"


Theo said casually, "It’s not something so costly, unlike the one you received on set that day, which was truly valuable. I’m just worried that after seeing that, anything else would pale in comparison for you."


Hearing that, Luna immediately facepalmed. "So you also know about that! News really does travel fast… don’t compare yourself with that weirdo, he’s mental!"


"Is that person your boyfriend?" Theo asked.


Luna almost choked on her own saliva. "Cough… no way! What made you think of something as scary as that?"


"Because you seemed really close," Theo said in a slightly despondent voice.


Luna’s head hurt. "My God! How is that close? Is scolding someone for being mental considered being close?"


Theo nodded. "To me it is. You are always so polite with me, and have never been frank or sharp with me."


Luna simply didn't know what to say. Was Big Demon King Goldberg secretly a masochist? Did he like being treated a little more harshly?


"In short, he has nothing to do with me now! He… he’s just mental, and stupidly likes to throw diamonds at people! If I ever see him again, I’ll definitely throw it right back at him!" Luna said in a relaxed tone, but there was a hint of dread when she was talking about that person.


"Nothing to do with you now, then does that mean there was something there before?" Theo picked up on this point specifically.


Luna coughed. "That… you could maybe say we dated before… if just one day counts…"


For some reason, Luna cared about Theo’s opinion of her. She grabbed her hair. "Theo, do you think it’s bad of me to have dated so many guys before?"


Theo looked very serious, and replied as if he was answering an extremely important question: "No, everyone has their own way of living, and they have things they don’t want anyone else to know. People who don’t know the truth have no right to stand on a high pedestal and punish or denounce other people."


Luna’s heart was warmed, and she smiled. "Theo, you sound like my brainless fan, no matter what I say, you’ll think I’m correct, right?"


"Brainless fan?" Theo didn't quite understand what this meant.


"That’s right, it describes those completely irrational fans who support their idols whether they’re right or wrong!"


Theo thought for a while, then murmured, "Mm, that’s very accurate."


Luna: "…"


Luna looked like she was silently struggling to contain some kind of emotion, and after a long beat, she sighed deeply. "Theo… do you know…"


"What?"


"Do you know, you are scarier than the aphrodisiac!" The look on Luna’s face was twisted as she pulled on her collar painfully.
