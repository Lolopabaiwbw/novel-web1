Chapter 127

When Luna arrived on set, she was informed that the whole filming schedule had been changed because Adam had asked for extended leave to attend to family matters.


That guy would chatter constantly about every little thing to her, but this time when such a big thing happened, why hadn’t he said anything to her at all?


Luna immediately called him to ask.


From his tone, Adam sounded in a very bad mood. "Why would I need to tell you? Don’t you hate me causing you trouble, or being a busybody? Weren’t you eager for me to stay as far away from you as possible? Now you’ve gotten your wish!"


Hearing this, Luna also got angry. "Adam, why are you in such a temper?"


Adam felt depressed; he was angry at himself for being too stupid. Finally, he forced himself to calm down as he spoke. "I'm at my dad's company at the moment, and today I’ve been working like a dog, there is definitely no way I’ll be able to get away. If you’re free in the evening, log into the game, I sent you something. Happy birthday!


Also, I sent a few things to your inbox. Go see it for yourself, whether you believe it or not is up to you! That's it! Bye!"


"This guy…" Luna looked helplessly at the phone after he hung up.


At this moment, David came to let her know, "Luna, you probably know about Adam! We were going to continue to shoot your kissing scene from yesterday, but given the adjustments, we’ll be doing the scene where you fight Emma. Later I’ll get someone to give you the new shooting schedule!"


Luna nodded. "Got it, Director!"


After speaking with him, she found a secluded corner under the shade of a tree to read the script.


While she was absorbed in her reading, she heard the sound of footsteps, and out of the corner of her eye, she glimpsed a figure that disgusted her. It was Liam who had come over.


Liam had sent Emma to the set today. Because it was her birthday, Liam had specially taken a day off to spend the whole of it accompanying her, and the girls in the production crew were all going crazy with envy.


Luna had no patience to speak to him, and only lifted her gaze as a way of asking him what he wanted.


Liam offered her a bottle of iced drink, and asked carefully, "Luna, will you be coming to Emma’s birthday party?"


Luna didn’t take it, and looked at him like he was an idiot. "Are you sure you want to ask me such a brainless question?"


"Luna, today is also your birthday. If you can come back, we can help you celebrate! I’ve already spoken to Uncle and Auntie, they’ve already agreed!"


Luna rolled her eyes. "Thank you so much for helping me celebrate my birthday in passing!"


Liam frowned slightly and heaved a deep sigh. "Luna, I really hardly recognize you anymore. When will you return to the kind and considerate Luna… back then it was all my fault. If it wasn't for me, Emma wouldn't have done that. If you want to blame someone, blame me, Emma’s innocent. She has been living with the guilt all these years, and her biggest wish is to receive your blessing. I really hope you will be able to come!"


"Guilt?" Every time Luna spoke to Liam, she felt like she was listening to a joke. "Guilty of snatching my identity? Guilty of stealing my parents? Guilty of sleeping with my man? Then she has a lot of guilt! Also, don't mention the word ‘kind’ to me. Back then I wasn’t kind, but stupid!"


Liam’s face was unsightly, and then he said firmly, "Luna, as long as you can forgive Emma, I’ll do whatever you want, except for testifying in court!"


"Are you sure?" Luna raised an eyebrow.


"Yes." Liam nodded.
