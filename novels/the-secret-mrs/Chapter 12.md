Chapter 12

Luna smiled genuinely and lightly clanked her beer against his cup. "Thanks!"


The moment she smiled, Theo felt blinded.


After Luna said her thanks, she looked at Little Treasure. "This is also thanks to Little Treasure. If it wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t have been able to rush over for my audition. Come darling, let’s have a drink too!"


Little Treasure looked at his glass of milk and then looked at Luna and his father’s beers. He felt unwilling, but ultimately, he clinked his cup against Luna’s beer and chugged all his milk.


Luna found his serious demeanor amusing. Did he know about drinking away his sorrows like adults?


Halfway through dinner, Theo went to the patio to receive an incoming call.


Luna nudged Little Treasure and handed her beer to him. "Hehe, are you curious about the taste? Quick, while your father isn’t here, have a little bit! But only one sip!"


Little Treasure’s eyes lit up like stars in the sky, and he lowered his head to drink a bit.


Although the taste wasn’t good, he was extremely happy nonetheless.


After Theo finished his call and came back, Luna was sitting properly and pretending nothing had happened.


Little Treasure was even more professional, slowly drinking his milk. Nothing out of the ordinary.


Theo looked as though he hadn’t notice anything, but a brief warmth flickered in his eyes.


The three of them had pretty good appetites. Luna had bought a lot of groceries, but they still managed to finish everything.


Luna saw the time and realized it was getting pretty late. Just as she thought about whether or not they should head back soon, lightning flashed outside the window, followed by loud booming sounds of thunder. It looked like the onset of a heavy storm.


"I watched the weather channel today, and they announced that tonight there was going to be a storm followed by a typhoon…"


Luna felt a headache coming on as she looked at the rain outside her window. Little Treasure looked at Luna, as did Theo…


Finally, after being stared at by the father and son pair for a while, she said, "It’s late. The weather isn’t looking good, so if Mister Goldberg were to bring Little Treasure home, it might be dangerous. How about… you two stay the night here with me?"


She had said this out of courtesy, and she felt that Theo would definitely not agree to it.


In the end…


Theo: "Alright."


Little Treasure nodded his little head repeatedly.


What, he agreed again…


Theo is too unreserved!


Why did she feel as though they both had been waiting for her to make the offer?


She was about to go crazy!


In the end, Theo and Little Treasure would stay the night.


The residence her company had given her was not big: it only had a bedroom and a living room. Deciding where the three of them would sleep was going to be a problem.


"Tonight, I’ll sleep in the living room. Mister Goldberg, you and Little Treasure can sleep in my bedroom. I’m going to go change the bedsheets first…"


"No need, I’ll sleep in the living room. You can sleep with Little Treasure in the bedroom." Theo’s tone allowed no further discussion.


Luna felt that she had sinned; not only did she let the big CEO eat a cheap hot pot, she was making him sleep in the living room.


If it had only been Theo without his son tonight — even if it was hailing — she wouldn’t have allowed him to stay, since a single man and a single woman under one roof would only be trouble, especially after what Theo had said to her during the day. But she had no choice, and there was also Little Treasure.


For Theo to bring his son home in such bad weather would be really dangerous. With Little Treasure here, the situation couldn’t be so bad, right?


Luna could only accept her fate. "I’ll go see if I can find some clothes for you both so that you can wash and change…"


After rummaging through her closet, she really did find some.
