Chapter 15

With a face like she was about to cry, Luna sat down obediently, like a student in class.


Theo rested his head in one hand. "Are you that scared of me?"


A late night Theo was much more unreserved than the daytime Theo, so he was even more dangerous.


Luna shook her head like a rattle, but then nodded her head. "You’re a king. Who wouldn’t be afraid of you?"


Theo swirled the water in his glass, and said faintly, "So because other people are afraid of me, you are afraid of me? Then, all the other women want to marry me, but why don’t you?"


This question nearly scared Luna into falling off her chair. She thought she had already dodged this bullet during the day, but she was just too naive.


This question made her feel like a thousand knives were directed at her. How was she supposed to answer it?


Luna raised a shaking hand. "Before I answer this question, can I ask a question first?"


Theo nodded. "Sure."


"Why me? Is it because Little Treasure is reliant on me? I think this is only temporary; wait until his emotions settle down, and it’ll be fine. Even if he is always going to be like this, you don’t need to… you don’t need to force yourself…" Luna earnestly advised and persuaded.


Theo lowered the glass in his hand and lifted his eyes to meet hers. "Miss Brown, I believe that I explained very clearly in the beginning: because you saved Little Treasure, I decided that I would repay you with my body."


This kind of explanation is so weird, it blinds me. There’s no way I could accept this, alright? Luna howled in her heart.


Luna felt that she couldn’t possibly get through to him if they persisted in this vein, so she could only put on an apologetic face and say, "Mister Goldberg, I really appreciate your intention, but I’m not a person who wants to get married, so…"


Theo furrowed his brow. "So you only want to sleep with me? And you don’t want to marry me?"


"That’s right… pah! No, no, no… I don’t mean it like that!" Luna was ready to just kneel before him. Can you not say such horrifying things?


"How regretful, I only accept sexual relationships with marriage as a prerequisite."


"Who would believe that…" Luna could not help saying. Didn’t you have a child outside of marriage?


Theo looked out the window with a slightly absent-minded expression. "Little Treasure was an accident. Even I don’t know who the mother is."


"…" Why did this sound so bad?


"Is it because you mind that I have a son?" Theo abruptly asked.


"Impossible!" Like Theo had said, if you cut open the brain of every woman who lived in the city, you would know they all wanted to be Little Treasure’s stepmother. How could she mind such a thing!


"Then why?"


Seeing his expression, she knew that Theo would not let her go until she answered the question.


Luna raised her head and let out a deep breath. "Mister Goldberg, marriage isn’t a game. Whether it’s to repay me or for any other reason, we should at least get to know each other. Do you know what kind of person I am? Do you know my past?"


"The one I want to marry is the present you. Your past has nothing to do with me." Of course this would be Theo’s answer. It was as tyrannical and overbearing as it could possibly be.


Luna’s expression turned frosty. "Except to me, my past is a part of me. I can’t cut out that part of me to marry you. Mister Goldberg, there is no point in being together with someone who follows different principles. I sincerely advise that you take back your ridiculous offer."


Her statement was followed by a cold silence.


Right when Luna thought the other party was so furious from shame he was about to fly into a rage, Theo opened his mouth and calmly said, "I understand."


Luna relaxed, and replied, "I’m going to bed then. Good night."


"Good night."


The man stared at her seemingly fragile silhouette, his gaze unfathomable like the ocean; the only thing unchanged was the boiling heat at the bottom of the sea.
