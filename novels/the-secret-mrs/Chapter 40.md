Chapter  40

"Cough, it’s really hard not to put the blame on him. When Luna was overseas, all the people she was with were only flings. After she was done with them, she threw them away. She’s really so cool, but this Liam should be the only man she’d ever truly loved."


It would have been better if he hadn’t said anything. After his explanation, Theo’s expression was even more unsightly.


Cleo felt a bit speechless. You two haven’t even started dating, what gives you the right to look like you want to massacre all her exes?


"Brother, even if you plan to wait for her to fall for you, you should bring her over to Glory World first — it’s inconvenient that she’s still with our competitor Starlight! From what I know, she’s miserable working over there with Emma," Cleo grumbled.


Theo glanced at the quiet girl hugging Little Treasure. "It’s not the right time yet."


After the trouble of bringing this person back to his place, another problem came up after they got out of the car.


When Luna saw the silver-white sports car, she stopped with a bright glitter in her eyes, then threw herself on it as if she would rather die than leave the car, her expression like that of a teenage girl who had found her dream man. "Oh! Little White! My darling!"


Theo’s expression went through several transformations as many emotions flickered over his face.


He had suffered so much, going into the women’s restroom to pick her up, and she hadn’t even treated him nicely. She even called him a big demon king, and now she was hugging his car and calling it darling?


"Hahaha… brother, you can’t possibly be jealous of a car! Who told you to drive this car out? When Luna was overseas, she was practically on the level of professional race car drivers, and she especially loves sports cars. Obviously, she’d be powerless against the allure of the world’s top sports car!" Cleo said on the side, delighting in his brother’s misfortune.


And then he realized that there was someone who was even more jealous than Theo.


And that was Little Treasure.


Watching his nickname "Darling" used on a car, the little guy was about to cry.


As for the one responsible for all of this, Luna was still running her hands all over the car with a besotted expression. "Darling, you’re so so handsome… really too dreamy! I really want to marry you!"


Theo’s knuckles cracked, itching for some violence.


When he proposed to her, she treated him like she had encountered a beast, and now she was actually proposing to a car?


Theo rolled up his sleeves. "Old Park, bring me a hammer."


Cleo immediately stopped laughing. "Don’t! Brother, calm down! This car is worth nearly a billion! If you don’t want it, then give it to me, I’ll take it away and I promise you won’t ever see it again!"


After he spoke, Cleo’s world spun as delicate-looking Luna threw him over her shoulder.


"Who dares touch my Little White?!" Luna’s face was filled with killing intent, as if she would go so far as to slaughter gods.


Cleo held his hip. "Good warrior, please spare me, I was wrong…"


This girl seemed to be a veteran practitioner of judo. He felt like he had lost half of his life after that one flip!


Luna then climbed into the driver’s seat, hugging the steering wheel tightly. "Little White, don’t be afraid…"


"Eldest Young Master, this…" Old Park, who had been chased away from the car, was bewildered.


Theo could not help but feel a headache coming on as he waved his hand, signaling for him to leave.


He then looked at his son. "Little Treasure, it’s late, go to sleep first."


Little Treasure, who was in a daze from losing Luna’s favor, shook his head like a rattle.


Theo didn’t get angry, only replied blandly, "You should know, girls don’t like it when the people they care most about see them in their worst state."


Hm, the people they care most about…


Little Treasure thought about it deeply for a few seconds before obediently turning around to leave.


Cleo widened his eyes. "Brother, aren’t you going overboard? You would even lie to a small child!"


"Is there anything else?"


"Of course there is something else, I want you to feel the blazing warmth of this incredibly huge light bulb!"


He could feel the piercing frost coming from his brother.


"Fine, I’ll leave, I’ll leave…" Cleo walked forward before glancing back.


A man, a woman, and a car. Don’t tell me something might happen…


Hehe, it was time for the record-breaking 63x optical zoom range camera that he had bought to shine!
