Chapter 87

Luna said easily, "If I can’t take even this small strike, how can I survive in the entertainment industry? Didn't you say last time that you believed in me?"


"But you don't look convincing at all right now." Theo had a solemn expression on his face.


Luna was confused by his words, then she finally remembered her makeover, so she explained, "This pale face and the dark circles are all just makeup which I did myself! I’m not pretending to be happy or tough, I can wipe it off to show you if you don't believe me…"


Theo suddenly reached out before she finished speaking, and touched her cheeks and eyes gently.


It was just a gentle touch, but Luna felt like she had been electrocuted, and couldn’t contain a shiver.


Luna’s reaction made Theo more concerned, and he quickly took his hand back. "Don’t try to be tough."


Luna laughed. "I won’t, if I can’t handle it, I’ll definitely fly right back to you and hug your thigh!"


Ruffled feathers smoothed down, Theo slowly relaxed. "Good."


After that, Luna scratched her head and looked at him as if she had something to say.


"Something you want to say?" Theo asked in a gentle voice, like he was a totally different person from last night.


Luna looked at him with a complicated expression on her face for a long time, and in the end couldn’t help saying, "Uh, that, Theo, have you ever thought about finding a woman to keep you company?"


"What do you mean?" Theo’s expression immediately turned cold.


"Don’t blame me for being nosy, I just think…" Luna considered her words carefully, then patted him sincerely on his shoulder. "I think you need a woman; in some matters, holding it in for too long is not good for your health!"


Wasn’t there a saying, one dreams at night what one thinks about in the day?


Theo looked like he kept his distance from girls, but from last night, it was clear that he really needed it…


Theo’s face was now thoroughly black.


Damn woman, who do you think did this to me? Who do you think left me in an awkward position and forced me to endure after I had tasted the flesh in my mouth?


Seeing Theo’s expression turn worse and worse, Luna coughed and quickly sneaked away. "I’m going to be late, I’m going to say goodbye to Little Treasure then head out to filming! Bye~"


Movie backlot in the suburbs.


The moment Luna appeared, a group of Adam’s fans, who had been waiting for a long time, immediately ran at her in a frenzy.


"Luna! Luna’s here! That whore is here! I can’t believe she dared to come!"


"Disgusting bitch! You’re not allowed to get close to our Muye! Hurry and leave the production!"


"Luna, leave the production! Luna, leave the entertainment industry! Leave!"


…


It was a chaotic scene; only a few guards protected Luna as they moved forward. The rest of the production crew was just enjoying the spectacle, now and then pointing and sneering at her.


The attention on her was like knives cutting into her inch by inch, and the malicious looks were like sinister poisonous snakes and ferocious beasts, ready to tear her to pieces.


Luna couldn’t help thinking about a female movie star last year, who had been at the height of her popularity, but in the end committed suicide because of vicious rumors; after she died, her suicide note only had a few words: rumors are lethal!


The crowd continually threw rotten eggs and vegetables at her, and someone even threw a rock, which almost hit her…


Seeing that the rock was about to hit the stylist Amy, who was enjoying the spectacle, Luna’s expression changed, and she leapt agilely to block that rock with her arm, when it was about half a meter away from hitting Amy.


In the next second, the spot where her arm had been hit started to bleed severely…
