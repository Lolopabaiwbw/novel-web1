Chapter 44

Only after Luna calmed down did she realize she had cried in Theo’s arms for almost half an hour.


Damn it… what the hell…


Except when it had been necessary when acting, it had been five years since she last cried.


"Uh, I'm sorry I dirtied your clothes…" She was very embarrassed when she saw the mess she had made of his shirt with her tears.


Theo said with a hint of a smile, "It was an honor for my shirt."


Luna was stunned, and her heart went crazy.


She had always thought that Theo was the kind of genius who had a high IQ but low EQ.


She could never have imagined that the Big Demon King could flirt so smoothly!


She was jealous! He was better at it than she was!


Theo reached out to smooth her hair in a natural gesture. "What will you do next? Look for a big thigh?"


Luna blinked, not understanding. "Huh? Look for what thigh?"


"Last night, you said you were going to look for a big and thick thigh; you even rejected mine as not thick enough." Theo gave her a deep and meaningful look.


"Cough cough cough…" Luna almost died choking on her own saliva.


Damn it, was there no end to the ridiculous things that had happened last night?


"Master Theo, don't listen to my rubbish, I was very drunk last night. There’s no way your thighs aren’t thick enough, yours are the thickest in the capital!" Luna said obsequiously, but then she realized her words might be a little ambiguous.


Her flattery put Theo in a good mood, and humor danced in his eyes. "Then why don’t you hug mine?"


"I, I, I…" Luna stumbled over her words.


Theo rubbed her head and finally decided to stop teasing her. "Enough, I won’t tease you anymore. Get out of the car and go sleep inside the house. Then you will have more energy to face your problems. Or do you want to stay a little longer with your little darling?"


"No, no, let's go back to the house!" Luna was naturally anxious to get out of the car.


When Theo got out of the car, he stood by the door and suddenly paused.


Luna scratched her head. "What is it?"


Theo walked with long strides towards a patch of foliage.


Luna followed curiously and then saw… Second Young Master Goldberg, sleeping sprawled in the underbrush with a camera in his arms.


She knew that Glory World owned not just one management company, but also more than three hundred media outlets, and Second Young Master Goldberg was also the boss of the paparazzi.


But this guy was going a bit overboard, going so far as to collect gossip on his own brother…


Luna’s lips twitched slightly. "This Second Young Master… should we wake him up? Won’t he catch a cold sleeping like this?"


Theo nodded, and then kicked him hard.


Cleo woke up with an "Ouch!"


As soon as he was awake, he started to cry. "You’re too much, why are the windows of the car so impenetrable! No matter what I did, I couldn’t see anything inside!"


Theo looked down his nose at his ridiculous brother. "Come to my study later. I have something to discuss with you."


"Oh…" Cleo rubbed his eyes and stood up, and then looked back and forth between them, muttering. "Why didn't the car shake? Did I miss it? No way! With my brother's stamina, it should have been rocking all night…"


Luna: "Why do you know what your brother’s stamina is like and how long he can go for…?"


It's easy for people to misunderstand, okay?


Cleo scratched his head. "Because he can beat me up all night!"


Luna: "…"


Fine, you win!


After returning to the room Theo had arranged for her, she was completely speechless.


In just half a day and a night, he actually managed to get the guest room completely redecorated.


The original cool and minimalist style of the room had been replaced by warm tones. Not just that, there was a full range of clothes in the closet all in her size, from pajamas to casual wear to evening dresses with matching accessories and handbags, all of which were top limited editions…


This was… inhuman wealth…
