Chapter 103

Emma also spoke up to persuade her. "Sister Brown, I know you’re not comfortable, but after all, you really were at fault, you can't drag the company down because of this personal drama between the both of you! The only way to resolve this now is to minimize the impact!"


Luna looked at Emma, who appeared as if her main concern was to protect the company, and murmured, "Senior Sister, if I remember correctly, from the beginning to the end, it was Mia who targeted me and framed me. I have always been mindful of Sister Sophia’s teachings to not embarrass the company and to always prioritize the company. I suffered in silence until now; even when I was being slandered, I didn't dare trouble the company, until some kind-hearted online friend stood up for me, only then was my reputation wiped clean!


Now what the online users and fans are angry over is Mia being a mistress. Clearly, Mia is the one who is not thinking about the company, framing an artiste from the same company and tarnishing the company’s image, right? Senior Sister, are you saying that if a mad dog chases someone down and bites him, and in the end falls into a ditch and dies, it is still that person’s fault?


If she posted on Weibo forgiving Mia, all her hard-won efforts to regain her reputation would definitely crumble at this last hurdle.


To indulgently forgive this type of person during this furore, did they think she was stupid?


Emma almost choked to death at Luna’s words. What kind-hearted online friend, it was clear that Luna was the one who had released that blackmail material, yet she could say all that with calm innocence.


On the side, Mia, who hadn’t been quiet for every long, immediately exploded at these words. "Luna, who are you saying is a mad dog! Say it clearly! You…"


Seeing that Mia was getting worked up again, Richard spoke up to cut her off. "No need to put up a public apology."


"Really?" Mia was instantly happy, but in the next second, she heard Richard continue, "Mia, write a statement to say you’re leaving the entertainment industry."


Mia immediately screamed. "What? You’re making me leave the entertainment industry? Why should I leave?! There’s no way I’m writing that kind of thing!"


Richard became impatient. "I’m already giving you face by letting you write that statement yourself! Don't take my last kindness for granted!"


"Don’t tell me it’s because of being a kept woman! There are so many female stars in the entertainment industry who are kept women, so many who become mistresses, why should I be the one to leave?!" Mia wasn't convinced.


"Because you are the only one dumb enough to let the whole world know about it!"


"What’s that got to do with me, it’s all because Alina that bitch betrayed me! Why haven’t you gone after her?!"


"How can I, when she’s already resigned? Alina was the most easygoing manager in the whole company, so ask yourself, besides her, who else would have been able to tolerate your temper? It was bad enough that you were always yelling at her, but when her son had a fever of more than 40oC and she wanted to take him to the hospital, you wouldn’t let her go no matter what. In the end, when she rushed there in the middle of the night, her son was so sick he had to be admitted into the ICU! So far he is still in critical condition!" Richard listed her misdeeds. It wasn’t just Alina, he had already long been fed up with having to deal with Mia’s mess non-stop.


Mia didn't think she was wrong in the slightest, and said in a careless manner, "He didn't die, right? There are doctors for that sort of thing, what use would it have been even if she went? She would destroy me over something like that?"


Mia still didn't understand how someone with a timid personality like Alina could suddenly do something like this. She was divorced, and her son was a chronic invalid. Every month, she spent so much on medical expenses. Without this job, how could she make a living?


She could never have guessed that a powerful figure like Chris Wheeler would deal with a nobody like her personally.
