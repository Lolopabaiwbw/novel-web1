Chapter 119

"Luna! Don't change the subject!" Hearing this, Adam’s mood grew even more sour, and he thought in his heart, Even if I’m your ex-boyfriend, can I compare with your Brother Liam, who is your childhood friend? You even call out his name when you’re dreaming.


Luna was helpless. "Fine, fine, fine. But I’m not changing the topic. Why does it seem like you’re being so noisy because you want to expose my relationship with you and also with Liam, in front of everyone?"


When will this guy stop being so childish?


Finally, Adam subsided.


"If you want to pay, go ahead!" In the end, Adam simply threw out a perfunctory remark.


Liam saw Luna whispering in Adam’s ear, and he frowned subtly. Was it his imagination? He had always felt that Luna and Adam’s relationship was as more than just colleagues…


Noticing that Liam was looking blankly in Luna’s direction, Emma shook his arm to draw his attention back, and said in a coquettish voice, "Brother Liam, did you bring the thing I asked for?"


Liam came back to himself. "Yes, I did."


With that, he passed her a stack of invitation cards, then said to everyone, "Tomorrow is Emma’s birthday, I hope everyone can come to her birthday banquet tomorrow evening!"


"Ah! It’s Teacher Brown’s birthday tomorrow!"


"I must go!"


"Teacher Brown's birthday banquet will definitely be a high-class affair, we have to experience it for ourselves!"


…


Emma smiled sweetly as she gave out the invitation cards one by one. When she gave one to Luna, she didn't forget to specially say, "Junior Sister, you must come!"


Luna turned the cup around in her hands aimlessly, her face expressionless as she stared at the red invitation.


When she was about to give the invitation to Adam, he didn't move. "Don't bother, I’m not going."


Hearing this, Emma’s face stiffened slightly, but in the next second, it smoothed back into a soft expression as she asked concernedly, "Adam, do you have something on tomorrow? Can you postpone it? I really do hope you can come! Please, please!"


She had already promised a number of her close friends who liked Adam that she would definitely have him come.


There was no way any man could resist a request made by a gorgeous beauty in such a pleading tone.


But Adam didn’t buy it at all, and his eyes even showed a bit of disdain as he said impatiently, "I can't postpone it, it’s also one of my friends’ birthday tomorrow!"


Saying that, he glanced in Luna’s direction.


Luna took a sip of wine, and said nothing.


"Ah… what a coincidence! Your friend has the same birthday as me! It must be a very important friend to you? That's really a pity! Once you’re done, feel free to come over any time, as our party will run through the night!" Emma said considerately.


Damn it, if she failed to invite Adam, wouldn’t she lose face in front of so many of her close friends?


Who on earth was Adam’s friend? Not only did they have the same birthday as her, they were also important enough for Adam to turn down her invitation in front of so many people!


Wait, the same birthday tomorrow…


Bewildered, Emma looked hesitantly in Luna’s direction.


She suddenly remembered that Luna also shared the same birthday, and it was also tomorrow!


Don’t tell me the friend Adam was talking about was Luna?


Just then, she suddenly remembered something. James Weather had announced that the person who invested the additional funds into the movie was Cleo. Her father had also told her that the other party had surreptitiously arranged with the director to have Luna take the second female lead. Why did Glory World’s Cleo want Luna to be the second female lead?


If her speculation was correct, and Luna and Adam were actually acquainted, then it had to be Adam who had helped Luna out by putting in a good word for her.


If that was the case, everything that had happened until now made sense…


This Luna, had she seduced Adam?
