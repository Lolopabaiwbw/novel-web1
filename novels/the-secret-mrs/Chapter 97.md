Chapter 97

After the three people came, things basically had nothing to do with Adam.


Theo invited Michelin star chefs to come and cook for them, Cleo had brought two bottles of fine wine from home, and Little Treasure monopolized Luna.


Five people sat around the table in a strange atmosphere.


It was fortunate that Cleo was here, which helped prevent an awkward silence. They ate and chatted idly.


"Come, let’s welcome home our big star! Second Uncle raises a glass to you!"


"Thank you!"


"By the way, I haven’t been able to ask you yet, how do you know Luna?" Cleo fished for information casually for his brother.


Hearing this question, Adam’s expression turned a little bad. It seemed he was reluctant to talk about it, and he replied vaguely, "We knew each other at school overseas. We graduated in the same year."


Cleo squinted at him, and spoke meaningfully. "I don’t think it was that simple, right? Don’t tell me she was one of the ex-girlfriends you chased and then dumped? After all, the women around you, if they’re not your mother or your fans, they’re your ex-girlfriends!"


Adam: "…"


Luna laughed and gave Cleo a thumbs-up. "Second Young Master, you're brilliant!"


"Oh, it seems I guessed right!" Cleo was pleased with himself. As expected, there was nothing in this world that he couldn’t guess correctly, haha.


"Only half right!" Adam contradicted with a blue face.


"Hmm? What do you mean?" Cleo didn’t understand.


"She’s my ex-girlfriend, that’s true, but she was the one who chased me, and she was also the one who dumped me!" Adam said, glaring at Luna in front of him like a bitter housewife.


After he said that, there was a faint gleam in Theo’s cold eyes, as he helped to cut up steak for Luna and Little Treasure.


Even Cleo was stunned. After all, it was the first time his guess was wrong. He slapped his hands on the table with a bang, and asked excitedly, "Really? True or not? This doesn’t make sense!"


Whatever Luna did when she was abroad, she couldn’t have been as absurd as Adam this kid, so he always thought that of the two, he could at least be sure that it had been Adam who made the first move. Who would have thought that in the end…


Adam poked angrily at a steak rib. "If you don't believe me, you can ask her!"


Why did this issue have to be dragged up again when everything was going so well? Luna said helplessly, "It was a complete accident!"


Cleo, who at first had simply intended to fish for information for his brother, was now thoroughly fired up by the gossip, and was insanely curious to hear more. "What on earth is going on? Quick, tell me! Quick, quick, quick!"


Adam was speechless.


You’re an elder, should you be gossiping about your junior’s private life?


Luna saw how ugly Adam’s face had become, and she also didn't intend to embarrass him in front of his elders, so she replied, "Nothing special. At that time, so many girls in the school liked him, and I was just one of them. As for breaking up, it was probably because after we got together, I realized he was different from what I had imagined, so I was a bit disillusioned!"


Luna’s words didn’t seem odd, but Cleo knew that things weren’t that simple, otherwise Adam's expression wouldn’t be like that.


Tsk, later I’ll force Adam that kid to drink a little more wine, then see if I can get anything more out of him.


Because Little Treasure was there, Luna didn’t drink tonight. After she finished eating, she sat at the table feeling a little bored, so she asked, "Mister Goldberg, can I take Little Treasure to go play games for a while?"


Theo nodded. "Go ahead."


The way he spoke to Luna didn’t seem very different, but it gave off the feeling that he was gentler with her than with other people.


Adam looked gloomy. It was clearly his game console, and the latest equipment that he had specially brought back home, yet she asked another man for permission, and took yet another man to go play!


Even if that man was only five years old!
