Chapter 117

"Ah! It’s raining —" There was a cry from the crowd.


Because the lanterns were made of paper, and some of the lotus-shaped ones weren’t even covered, they were instantly put out by the rain.


Luna, who had been just about to kiss Adam, stopped because of this sudden change, and instinctively covered her head with her hands. "Why is it raining? Ouch, it hurts! Why does it seem that it’s even hailing?!"


Adam had been so nervous that his heart had nearly stopped beating, but as a result of the abrupt stop to the scene, he almost passed out from lack of air. "Damn it! Hasn’t there been a drought recently? It hasn't rained for months! And why the hell is it hailing on such a hot day?!"


In the car, Cleo was baffled.


Raining? The weather had been fine, how could it be raining? Eh, wait… hearing the thumps on the roof of the car, it seemed like it was even hailing heavily…


At this moment, Cleo had a flash of realization. His mouth twitched as he stared speechlessly at his elder brother, who was still as a mountain and didn’t look the least bit surprised. "You actually made it rain… brother, you're defying the heavens! And isn’t this a little too fierce? It’s even hailing!"


Seeing how filming had been forced to stop, the pressure around Theo retreated like a tide, and his thin lips spit out one cold word: "Drive."


"Yes, Eldest Young Master." The driver started the engine, and in the dark, the black car silently left the filming site.


David also hadn’t expected such a situation to happen, and was very distraught. If the filming earlier had continued, it would definitely have been an incredibly beautiful image.


"Ah, forget it, nothing good comes easy! Let's call it a day! But don't leave yet, let’s have dinner together! Last time we weren’t able to have a dinner to welcome Adam, so we must do it today!" David said to everyone.


The production crew had been suffering a lot of setbacks recently, so this was a good time to mingle and bond with each other.


The staff who had been listless because of the sudden change in weather instantly perked up and cheered.


Adam gave an unenthusiastic response — he was clearly in a bad mood.


Luna threw a towel at him. "What kind of expression is that? Are you disappointed that I didn’t force a kiss on you?


"Rubbish, I’m just not happy that I have to act it out with you again!" Adam glared at her, then said in a warning tone, "Don’t tell me you’re busy again tonight?"


"I’m not, why would I be busy!" Luna said as she sent Theo a message out of habit to let him know.


Adam sneaked a look at her phone to see the text she was sending, then realized something wasn’t right. "Luna, why did you change your WeChat nickname?"


The original "Loneliness like Never-ending Arrows in the Void" had been changed to "Sugar Luna".


"Mm, because of Theo," Luna replied.


Adam's pupils contracted. "Theo made you change it? He told you to change, then you did! You used that nickname for so many years, no matter how much I laughed at you before, you were too lazy to change it! But you actually changed it when he made you do it?"


Luna looked haughtily at him. "Can you not get so worked up? He didn't ask me to change it, okay?"


"Then why did you change it?"


"It’s because he didn't make me change it, and he even said my nickname wasn’t bad, and wanted me to help think of a similar one for him!"


Adam: "…" Fuck! His uncle had savage skills in picking up girls! Even this could work?


Luna sighed. "You know, it’s fine for a rough guy like me to use such a shocking name. But he is the CEO of a listed corporation, if I lead him astray with Martian language, wouldn’t I be committing too big a sin? So I spent a long time trying to persuade him that Martian language was obsolete, and to prove it, I even changed my own nickname!"
