Chapter 165

After that, Luna opened Weibo, only to see a page full of cursing. It was even several times worse than that time with Mia, but after all, compared to Mia, Emma was much more popular. Her fans’ battle power was much more powerful.


[That slut Luna keeps hiding and won’t appear, so she must be guilty! She must have seen that she’d been exposed so she ran off, right? After all, she’s already attempted murder! If they were to go to court, she would definitely have to go to jail! ]


[To be vilified once is just others being jealous, but she’s been in the same situation so many times, so it must be her character that’s the problem! This time, she was even caught in the act! ]


[Emma has such a good reputation in the entertainment industry and she has even supported this junior sister so many times. Who would have thought that she would actually return kindness with enmity, like a Schweinhund! It’s because of people like her that the entertainment circle’s trends are getting worse! ]


[Don’t you guys feel that this might have been Luna’s scheme from the start? She gets rid of Mia first so that she can secure the role of the second female lead, and then hurts Emma to get the role of leading actress! ]


[That’s so terrifying! I’m so scared! As expected, a beautiful woman is not a good thing! ]


…


Theo glanced at her cell phone out of the corner of his eye, and knit his brows after seeing the vicious comments. "Don’t look anymore."


Luna was sitting cross-legged, the thermometer between her lips as she replied unintelligibly, "It’s nothing. Seeing these is actually really fun!"


"Measure it properly, don’t speak."


"Mm." You’re the one who made me speak…


Having finally finished measuring, Theo looked at the thermometer. "37.1oC."


Luna was immediately pleased as she said, "I said I was alright! Actually, my body is really healthy! So can I leave the hospital now?"


"You still need to be hospitalized for a few days for observation."


"Ah? I still have to be hospitalized? But I really miss darling Little White!" Luna decisively chose to bring up Little Treasure.


"He’s already on his way here," Theo said in a tone which left no room for discussion.


"Ah, okay…" Luna finally had nothing more to say.


Theo tidied up and put the meal table away, then sat in the chair besides the bed. "What do you plan to do now?"


Luna immediately remembered something. "I actually was about to tell you about it. Can you send a copy of the evidence to my phone? I need to prepare to first send it to a person!"


Theo glanced at her. "Jack Garcia?"


Luna was already used to Theo’s quick intelligence, but she still couldn’t help but admire him. "You truly deserve to be called Lord Boss! You’re so quick-witted! I’m preparing to make Jack fight his own allies by using the evidence to blackmail Emma!"


After Luna excitedly finished saying her piece, she immediately coughed and anxiously looked at Theo, "Doing this… would I be too vicious?"


Theo didn’t reply, and after some consideration, he said, "The main issue is that this doesn’t bring you any benefits, and you’re really letting Jack off easy."


Luna scratched her head. "What you said is not wrong, but my main priority is to cause trouble for Emma. I didn’t really think about anything else."


Theo thought for a moment and then said, "Instead of letting Jack gain profit, why don’t you do it yourself?"


When Luna heard this, her eyes bulged out in surprise. "Would… would this work?"


"Why not?" Theo countered, and then continued to elaborate. "Based on Emma’s capability, you should be able to extort about eight million from her. This is your best opportunity to dissolve your contract with Starlight Entertainment. You can use the money to pay the penalty fee."


"…" Luna was utterly speechless after hearing Theo’s words.


At the most, she had only wanted to incite other people, but the Big Demon King was truly excellent. Not only did he not admonish her actions, he even taught her how to be even worse…


‘Schweinhund’ is German for ‘pig-dog’, and is considered an extremely offensive insult.
