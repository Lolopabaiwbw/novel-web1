Chapter 54

The next morning.


After Luna left, an uneasy Theo gave Cleo a call.


"Send someone on set."


"Bro, are you worried someone’s bullying Sister-in-law? This is something anyone who wants to become a star has to go through, it’ll make her tougher! If she doesn’t experience this for herself, she’ll never be able to stand on her own!" Cleo used the same tone Theo would take when he was lecturing someone.


Theo: "She doesn't need those."— meaning, he would be the one to protect her.


Cleo: "…" Hehe.


Cleo’s heart was desolate at his brother’s biased treatment.


Last year without saying a word you threw me into the mess that was Glory World, and wouldn’t even let anyone help me.


"OK OK, I’ll arrange for someone to be on set to make sure not even a single strand of her hair is harmed!"


"You can take a week off next month," Theo suddenly said.


"Huh… bro, what did you say?" Cleo couldn't believe his ears. "You’re letting me take time off, and it’s even a whole week? You haven’t let me take leave in three years!"


"Don't want it?"


"Want, want, want! Of course I want it! But… why are you suddenly treating me so well?" Cleo didn't understand, and tried to recall their earlier conversation.


Finally, he realized: it was all because of that word — Sister-in-law.


Just because he had called Luna Sister-in-law?


This break was making him both happy and sad.


"Eldest Young Master, Doctor Henderson is here." The maid’s voice came from outside the study.


A slim man in a simple suit was standing next to the maid; he had a gentle look and a warm smiles, and seemed a very pleasant person.


Theo hung up the phone and turned to the visitor. "You’re here, have a seat."


Milo Henderson put his bag down and sat on the sofa. "What is it? Is Little Treasure not feeling well?"


"You can see for yourself, he’s in the kitchen," Theo answered.


"Kitchen?" Milo lifted an eyebrow, and then headed to the kitchen.


A moment later, Milo came back smiling. "When did Little Treasure pick up juicing as a hobby? Also, he seems happy! Did something happened?"


"Something did happen recently. A few days ago, I was too busy to look after Little Treasure, and then Cleo took him to a bar without my knowing…"


Theo explained the situation to the doctor simply.


Milo’s face changed as he listened to Theo, and in the end, he said happily, "Something good came out of a bad situation for Little Treasure! I’ve mentioned before, he’s too uninterested in everything; something that interests or motivates him is good for his recovery.What’s more, this is a living person! You didn’t have that girl stay on as Little Treasure’s nanny or tutor?"


Theo: "Because she is Little Treasure’s future mother."


"Cough cough cough…" Seeing Theo’s expressionless face, Milo was astonished. "What did you say? Are you doing this for Little Treaure, or for yourself…"


The cold expression on Theo’s face melted slightly. He looked outthe window and said, "Doctor Henderson, I think your previous conclusions were correct."


"You… you’ve fallen in love with this girl?" Milo got very excited. "I knew I was right! How could you be an asexual! Tell me more, when you see her, does your heart speed up and your blood boil? Does it make you want to get closer to her and make love to her?"


Theo thought about it for a bit, and said, "That’s basically correct!"
