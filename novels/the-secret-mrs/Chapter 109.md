Chapter 109

Never expecting that the girl would make such a request of him, Theo was obviously taken aback. He looked at her back and asked lightly, "Why?"


Even though he was very happy to satisfy such a wonderful request by this girl.


Realizing that her words were too ambiguous, Luna quickly made a "Pei" sound. "Don’t misunderstand! I meant it literally, there wasn’t any deeper meaning! Er, actually, the literal meaning also seems very dirty… cough, in short, what I meant was I bought you some clothes when I was shopping today, do you want to try it on? Trying it on now saves you having to change clothes and take them off and change again. Aren’t I clever?"


Theo looked a little surprised at her words, and seemed a bit overwhelmed by her consideration. "You bought it for me?"


He thought that she had definitely bought them for Little Treasure.


"Yes, but, cough cough, I used your card!" Luna looked a bit embarrassed as she scratched her nose. "Actually, I was prepared to use my own money, and to buy it as a gift for Little Treasure. But who knew after getting a new car motor last month, my card would have no money on it, so I had to use yours. Then, on the way back, I saw a man’s suit in the men’s section which perfectly matched the color of the clothes I bought for Little Treasure, so I couldn’t help buying it!"


"I see." Even though she hadn’t specifically intended to buy something for him, it was enough to cheer him up.


"I asked the salesgirl, if you try it on and don't like it, you can return it. Quick, go try it on and see whether you like it or not!" Luna rushed him.


Theo didn't hesitate at all: " I like it." She bought it herself, and it was the first time she bought him clothes, how could he not like it.


"You haven't even seen what it looks like!" Luna muttered, before stepping back and handing him one of the shopping bags.


Theo took the bag. "You only bought for me and Little Treasure, you didn't buy anything for yourself?"


Luna sighed. "Eh, I don’t have money, wait ‘til I earn some, then I’ll buy."


Just as Theo was about to say that she could swipe his card, Luna took out a black card from her bag. "Oh, right, here you go! Using this was just so cool! Today, it made a woman who was fighting me for the clothes I wanted to buy jealous to death!"


Theo could only sigh and say, "Keep it, I’m usually too busy to have time to buy things for Little Treasure. If you see anything suitable, buy it straightaway. Of course, I would be very happy if you helped pick something out for me."


"Are you that confident in my taste? Then don’t change your mind later when you try it on!" Luna didn’t stand on ceremony with him, and took the card back straightaway. "Then I’ll give this back to you when I move out. I’ll leave you to get changed!"


Just as she was about to go, behind her, the man suddenly grabbed the hand that was free.


That startled Luna, and she was about to turn around again when she remembered that Theo was still half naked, so she could only remain in that twisted position, her arm caught behind her. "What is it?"


Theo tightened his grip on her hand slightly. "Luna, Little Treasure’s condition has improved a lot recently, and he’s not always bothering you anymore. He listens well, doesn’t disturb you, and doesn’t disrupt your work. As long as everyday, he can see you, wait for you to come home, and know that you’re sleeping in the next room, he’s very happy and calm…


I know I no longer have a reason to keep you here, but as Little Treasure’s father, I haven’t done enough for him at all, and I really hope for this kind of happiness to last a little longer for Little Treasure.


Three months, can you stay for three more months, at the most? If you want to leave after that, I won’t force you to stay. During this time, you can treat this place as your own home; do whatever you want, you don’t have to be polite.


You can swear when you’re angry, eat durian and garlic, drink at a bar and come back late… I only have one request. In these three months, can you show some restraint, and don't bring men back here?"


Luna had almost been moved to tears by the first part of his speech, but by the end of it, she almost vomited three liters of blood.


The more she listened, the more Theo sounded like a gentle and virtuous wife, while she was the scummy, degenerate husband.
