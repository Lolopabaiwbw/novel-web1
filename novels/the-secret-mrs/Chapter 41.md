Chapter 41

"What… what do you want?" Seeing Theo slip into the passenger seat all of a sudden, Luna gripped the steering wheel tightly, as if he was protecting what belonged to her.


Theo sat back, his eyes darkening.


Heh, what did he want?


It was better for her not to know.


Theo was now only wearing a white shirt; his collar was too tight, so he violently ripped the first button open, then the second, then the third…


Luna watched Theo next to her keenly, lost in seeing a handsome man rip his own shirt off to reveal his firm chest, to the point even her beloved Little White was forgotten.


Theo didn't noticed her looking at him. Trying hard to suppress his ridiculous, unreasonable jealousy over a car, he lit a cigarette and took a long, deep drag before releasing a breath of smoke.


The moment that Theo pulled out the cigarette, Luna could no longer stand it. She stared unblinkingly at this man: the slight movement of his Adam’s apple, that white cigarette held loosely between his thin lips, and the smoke coming out of his mouth…


Theo felt the burning stare on him, and when he turned his head, he saw the look of "hunger" on Luna’s face.


For a moment, Theo was almost tricked by that look; then he realized it was not him she was craving for.


She was "hungry" for the cigarette between his lips.


If nothing else, Cleo was good at gathering information; his background check on Luna had been extremely detailed, from her upbringing to hobbies, even the fact that she was trying to quit smoking…


Theo understood immediately that Luna was having smoke cravings.


It wasn’t just an ex-lover and a car he had lost to, now even a cigarette was more attractive than he was.


Theo had never felt more frustrated or more insecure in his entire life.


From the very first moment Theo saw Luna, he wanted her for his own. However, he decided to take it slow to protect her feelings. Luna, on the other hand, had never really been interested in him, and was always setting boundaries.


She would rather hug someone else’s thigh, than be his wife.


People say that if an ex cannot be forgotten, it means the new lover is not good enough. Does that mean he really wasn’t good enough? She had even gotten ridiculously drunk over someone who had dumped her.


He clearly knew that the best approach was to take it slow, and had always followed this rule. He had never imagined he would lose reason to this extent, that something this insignificant could blow all his senses away.


Theo smoked the cigarette as his thoughts chased themselves all over the place. The red glow of the cigarette tip was reflected in his eyes, and he asked in a deep, low voice, "Want some?"


Luna nodded without hesitation; it wasn’t clear if she was attracted to the cigarette or to the man beside her.


Theo flicked cigarette ash away, and took one more drag on the cigarette under Luna’s naked stare; in the next moment before she knew it, his cigarette-flavored lips were firmly pressed against hers…


Luna’s eyes shot wide open; she was surrounded by the strong scent of tobacco accompanied by the man’s cool breath; a second later, her lips were gently pried open, and smoke breathed into her mouth…


Distracted and unprepared, Luna started coughing severely from the smoke.


The cigarette was now half gone; with a gloomy look on his face, Theo took another drag. With tears in her eyes from coughing, the person next to him was more attractive than ever, and Theo asked, "Want more?"
