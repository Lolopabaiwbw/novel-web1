Chapter 89

It was also a coincidence that today, most of Luna’s scenes would be with Mia.


As Luna was sitting in the shade of a tree and studying the script, an odd voice suddenly sounded in her ear —


"Yo, isn't this our big star? Luna, you’re really famous now, everyone knows you! Hehe, I knew you did all those disgraceful things! You're really so shameless, to dare come here after what’s happened!" Mia said with a gloating expression on her face.


As long as Luna was kicked out of the production, she could seize this chance to replace her, then she could play opposite Brother Adam.


Luna bit her lip and her body trembled; she silently looked embarrassed.


Mia was even more satisfied seeing this. She approached Adam and said girlishly, "Brother Adam, you should stay away from this sort of person, otherwise she will ruin your reputation! She's already making you start to lose fans!"


As Mia drew near, a strong smell of perfume immediately drifted over. The veins on Adam’s forehead popped. He was about to blow up on the spot, but at the thought of Luna’s warning, he took a deep breath and managed to bear it.


Seeing how Adam wasn’t responding to her, Mia thought that encountering this situation had put him in a bad mood, so she thoughtfully consoled him. "Brother Adam, don’t worry! Sooner or later, the production team will be pressured to switch Luna out!"


"You're very noisy." Adam had to exert all his self-control to replace all the curses he wanted to say with three words.


"Sorry, Brother Adam, I won't disturb your rest." Feeling a little aggrieved, Mia walked away.


She was unhappy that Adam’s cold attitude was still unchanged, but after thinking for a bit, she quickly felt reassured. Anyway, once she landed the role of the second female lead, she would have the opportunity to get along with Brother Adam.


At the thought of the intimate scenes, she couldn’t contain her excitement.


Having said that, why did the director still want her to come today and continue acting with Luna? What a waste of time!


But she really liked the scene they would be filming today, since there was a part where she would slap Luna’s face.


Hmph, I’ll definitely show you then!


"Director, I think for this scene, the effect would be better if I really slapped her. What do you think?" Mia, who had never shown much interest in shooting, actually sought out the director of her own accord to talk about the scene.


How could David not know what she was thinking? He said heavily. "For the majority of it we’ll do a cheat, at most it’s enough for you to just touch her face!"


"Got it!" While Mia’s mouth replied agreeably, she completely had no intention of following his words. She had made up her mind to deliver a real slap, and to do it several times, and make this b*tch suffer.


Anyway, this wouldn’t be the first time she had taken personal revenge through her acting, and she had always been successful.


When all the departments were ready, filming began.


In this scene, Ella Smith had just entered the palace under the alias Clara Foster. She was only a little palace maid, but because the emperor had been eyeing her, Princess Daisy had become envious, and had called her to her chambers to embarrass her.


"Shameless bitch, you dare seduce the emperor right under my nose!" After Princess Daisy had finished speaking, she slapped her hard.


The moment Mia brought her hand down, Luna’s eyes narrowed slightly, and she turned a little to the side, cleverly avoiding the camera and Mia’s hand. But her body looked as if it had been struck with huge strength, sending her whole person falling to the ground. Then her face twisted, and with a "ptui" sound, she spat out a mouthful of blood.


"Luna —" David was shocked, and the other staff who were watching were also stunned as they gathered around her.


"Mia, is this your first day acting? You can’t even control your own strength?" David, who was usually good-natured, was really angry this time.


He could not meddle in things outside of the movie, but if someone took such a cheap shot in his movie, there was no way he would tolerate it!


"I…" Mia herself was also shocked; while it was true that she had deliberately used some strength, it was definitely not to the point that could make Luna fall down and spit blood. Also, just now, she clearly felt that Luna had avoided her, and she had not hit her at all. Hence, she straightened her neck and cried out in protest, "I just slapped her gently, I didn’t use any strength at all! She’s pretending!"


In filmatography, ‘to cheat’ is to change the relative positions of actors or props in order to shoot the same scene from different angles.
