Chapter 99

Late at night, Public Relations Department of Glory World Group.


Chris Wheeler was stressing over the scandal of Millie Holland driving while drunk and hitting someone, when his personal cell phone suddenly rang.


He had been prepared to impatiently throw his phone aside, but in the next second he was frightened into a cold sweat when he saw the caller ID. He immediately flipped over to sit up, and received the call in a flurry —


"Hello, President Goldberg, my apologies! We’re dealing with this matter, and will definitely solve it latest by tomorrow evening!"


"What?" The man's cold and distant voice came through the phone.


"Ah? It's about Millie's drunk driving… you weren’t looking for me because of this?" Chris was confused. So Big Boss wasn’t calling this late at night to interrogate him?


"No."


Chris immediately sighed in relief. He was really very busy, and President Goldberg had never gotten involved in the business of Glory World. Even if the matter involving Glory World’s First Sister Millie was a huge issue in their eyes, for Theo, it likely didn’t make even the smallest ripple.


So, why was Big Boss personally calling him at this time?


Chris felt even more uneasy. "So the reason you’ve call me…?"


"Make Mia leave the entertainment industry within 24 hours." Theo directly gave him an order.


"Mia? President Goldberg, which Mia is that?"


"Starlight Entertainment."


Hearing the voice on the other end of the phone, Chris was greatly surprised. So it was that gaudy-looking Mia who nevertheless had been hyped up by Starlight Entertainment as the "The No.1 Beauty in the Entertainment Industry"?


He had wondered what type of big shot it was!


Chris was still bewildered, but he dared not ask too many questions. He responded readily. "Yes, President Goldberg, I understand! As far as I know, Mia recently had a falling out with a female artiste in their company. The other party wasn’t the good type either, and she had a lot of blackmail material on Mia. She really knew how to get someone else to do her dirty work, and she gave the lot to a big V gossip blogger on our company’s operations team. Mia has offended too many people. This time, everyone’s going to kick her when she’s down, I reckon it’ll be hard for her to get away. But if we want to force her to leave the entertainment industry, we’ll need to fan the flames!"


"Handle it quietly." Theo instructed him.


"Yes. Don’t worry, President Goldberg!"


After hanging up the phone, Chris immediately passed everything he had been handling to the deputy director, then dealt with this matter himself.


The matter this time really was too easy. Asking him to handle it was simply like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The artiste who had been fighting with Mia had already done 80% of the work, he just needed to deal the last blow.


But she was just a small, B-list artiste, what on earth had she done for Big Boss to personally command that she be blacklisted?


No matter how much Chris tried, there was no way he would have guessed that Theo's real purpose was not to blacklist Mia, but to support Luna, a little actress who was even less famous than Mia, and whose name till now Chris probably didn’t even remember…


The next morning.


After Luna woke up, she was a bit confused. Why was she in the Goldberg residence?


She clearly remembered that she had played games continuously with Little Treasure for two hours, and finally had been so tired that she had fallen asleep on the sofa in Adam’s living room.


While she was puzzling this out, suddenly there was a bang at the window behind the bed.


Startled, Luna quickly went over to see what was going on.


As soon as she opened the window, she saw a golden head…


Black lines appeared on Luna’s head. "Adam, what are you doing?"


Adam, who paid the most attention to his image, was actually still wearing the same clothes from last night, now crumpled, and his hair was also a mess. He had an agitated expression on his face. "Luna, get down here! I need to talk to you about something! Hurry up!"


Head aching, Luna sighed. She had known it wouldn’t be a good thing for this person to know that she was staying here. He actually came running early in the morning to smash her window…
