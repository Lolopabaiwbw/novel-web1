Chapter 66

This situation was quickly driving Luna insane. She said to Adam in a low voice, "I should be asking you that! How do you know Theo?!"


Adam: "I told you, he’s my uncle!"


Luna: "Then why didn't you tell me earlier?!"


Adam: "You never asked!"


Luna: "…"


"How do you and my uncle know each other?" Adam looked between the two of them; the more he looked, the more he felt that something wasn’t right, but he couldn’t tell exactly what it was.


"It’s a long story…" Exhausted, Luna touched her forehead. These four words were to both Adam and Theo.


Adam looked like he was dying to ask questions, but didn’t dare open his mouth in Theo’s presence.


She smelt nice after having just showered. The large, baggy T-shirt showed off her slender, white legs, and one hand was still trying to cover the hole in the shirt. It was a view that made the blood boil, and knowing that she looked like this in another man’s house made Theo want to suddenly destroy something.


While he raged a few times over in his heart, it happened in the space of a few seconds which almost went unnoticed. On the outside, Theo just had a slightly cold expression, and he glared at Luna. "Are you planning to stay here, or go back with me?"


The words were said flatly, but carried unimaginable weight.


Adam caught the underlying meaning, and he looked at Luna in shock and disbelief.


What was the meaning of this?? They didn't just know each other, they were also living together?


Luna looked at the icy cold Theo, then looked at the furious Adam. She swallowed with difficulty. "I… I’ll go back after all."


The cold air Theo was emitting thawed slightly.


Adam lost his temper and immediately grabbed Luna’s wrist, his beautiful, light blue eyes filled with both nervousness and the rage of betrayal. "You promised to keep me company tonight!!!"


As soon as he said the words, Luna wanted to send him flying with one punch. Young man, don’t make things sound so misleading!


She lifted her head and looked at Theo; as expected, he looked like he was quickly reaching his limit, as if there was only one metal bar left before the beast came bursting out…


Luna took back her hand and held onto her temper as she persuaded, "Adam, I need to film tomorrow, didn’t Brother Sheldon say you also have something on in the morning? Let’s wait for a day when we’re both free, then I’ll play PC games with you another time, alright?"


Luna emphasized "play PC games" on purpose.


After she finished speaking, she quickly grabbed her big, black bag, and without changing into something else, she ran for her life from this troublesome place, hand still covering the hole in the shirt.


Theo looked intensely at Adam before catching up to Luna.


Seeing the backs of the two as they left together, as well as Theo’s provoking look as they left, flames burned in Adam’s eyes…


Damn it! No wonder that woman knew that road was blocked…


Luna, how much are you hiding from me!


At that moment, Luna was trembling as she ran back, when the weight in her hand was suddenly removed; Theo was helping her carry her bag.


Then she felt something settle on her shoulders; Theo had put his coat on her.


"Thank you…" Luna thanked him in embarrassment.


Theo’s face remained cold, and he didn't react at all.


Any reaction would have been good; as long as there was one, she would know how to respond — this lack of reaction made people the most nervous…
